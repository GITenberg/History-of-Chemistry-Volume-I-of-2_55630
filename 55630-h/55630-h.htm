<p><span class="smcap">A History of the Sciences</span> has been planned
to present for the information of the general
public a historic record of the great divisions
of science. Each volume is the work of a
writer who is accepted as an authority on his
own subject-matter. The books are not to be
considered as primers, but present thoroughly
digested information on the relations borne by
each great division of science to the changes in
human ideas and to the intellectual development
of mankind. The monographs explain
how the principal scientific discoveries have
been arrived at and the names of the workers
to whom such discoveries are due.</p>

<p>The books will comprise each about 200 pages.
Each volume will contain from 12 to 16 illustrations,
including portraits of the discoverers
and explanatory views and diagrams. Each
volume contains also a concise but comprehensive
bibliography of the subject-matter. The
following volumes will be issued during the
course of the autumn of 1909.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Chemistry</span>, as an art, was practised thousands
of years before the Christian era; as a
science, it dates no further back than the middle
of the seventeenth century. The monumental
records of Egypt and the accounts left us by
Herodotus and other writers show that the
ancient Egyptians, among the earliest nations
of whom we have any records, had a considerable
knowledge of processes essentially chemical in
their nature. Their priests were adepts in certain
chemical arts, and chemical laboratories
were occasionally attached to their temples, as at
Thebes, Memphis, and Heliopolis. It is to be
supposed, too, that in a cultured class, as the
priesthood undoubtedly was, there would be now
and again curious and ingenious persons who
would speculate on the nature and causes of the
phenomena which they observed. But there is no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
certain evidence that the Egyptians ever pursued
chemistry in the spirit of science, or even
in the manner in which they and the Chaldæans
followed, for example, astronomy or mathematics.
The operations of chemistry as performed
by them were of the nature of manufacturing
processes, empirical in character and utilitarian
in result. It was comparatively late in the
world’s history that men were found willing to
occupy themselves in chemical pursuits in order
to gain an insight into the nature of chemical
change, and to learn the causes and conditions
of its action.</p>

<p>Although we have cited the ancient Egyptians
as practising the chemical arts, there is no proof
that these arts actually originated with them.
China, India, Chaldæa have each in turn been
regarded as the birthplace of the various technical
processes from which chemistry may be
said to have taken its rise. Nevertheless, it is
mainly from Egyptian records, or from writings
avowedly based on information from Egyptian
sources, that such knowledge as we possess of the
earliest chemical processes is derived. It is
significant that the word “chemistry” has its
origin in <i>chemi</i>, “the black land,” the ancient
name for Egypt. The art itself was constantly
spoken of as the “Egyptian art.”</p>

<p>“The word <i>chemistry</i>,” says Boerhaave in
the Prolegomena of his <i>New Method of Chemistry</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
(Shaw and Chambers’s translation, London,
1727),</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">in <i>Greek</i> should be wrote χημíα, and in <i>Latin</i> and
<i>English</i> <i>chemia</i> and <i>chemistry</i>; not as usual,
<i>chymia</i> and <i>chymistry</i>.</p>

<p>The first author in whom the word is found
is <i>Plutarch</i>, who lived under the Emperors
<i>Domitian</i>, <i>Nerva</i>, and <i>Trajan</i>. That philosopher,
in his treatise of <i>Isis</i> and <i>Osiris</i>, takes
occasion to observe that <i>Egypt, in the sacred
dialect of the country, was called by the same name
as the</i> black <i>of the eye</i>—viz., χημíα—by which
he seems to intimate that the word <i>chemia</i> in
the <i>Egyptian</i> language signified black, and that
the country, <i>Egypt</i>, might take its denomination
from the <i>blackness</i> of the soil.</p>

<p>But [continues Boerhaave] the etymology and
grammatical signification of the name is not so
easily dispatched. The critics and antiquaries,
among whom it has been a great subject of
inquiry, will not let it pass without some further
disquisition. Instead of <i>black</i>, some will have
it originally denote <i>secret</i>, or <i>occult</i>; and hence
derive it from the <i>Hebrew</i> <i>chaman</i>, or <i>haman</i>—a
<i>mystery</i>, whose radix is <i>cham</i>. And, accordingly,
<i>Plutarch</i> observes that <i>Egypt</i>, in the
same sacred dialect, is sometimes wrote in
<i>Greek</i> χαμíα—<i>chamia</i>; whence the word is easily
deduced further from <i>Cham</i>, eldest son of Noah,
by whom Egypt was first peopled after the
deluge, and from whom, in the Scripture style,
it is called the <i>land of Cham</i>, or <i>Chem</i>. Now,
that <i>chaman</i>, or <i>haman</i>, properly signifies <i>secret</i>
appears from the same <i>Plutarch</i>, who, mentioning
an ancient author named <i>Menethes Sibonita</i>,
who had asserted that <i>Ammon</i> and <i>Hammon</i>
were used to denote the god of <i>Egypt</i>, <i>Plutarch</i>
takes this occasion to observe that in the
<i>Egyptian</i> language anything secret or occult<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
was called by the same name, ἅμμον—<i>Hammon</i>....
Lastly, the learned <i>Bochart</i>, keeping
to the same sense of the word, chooses to derive
it from the <i>Arabic</i> <i>chema</i>, or <i>kema</i>—to <i>hide</i>;
adding that there is an <i>Arabic</i> book of secrets
called by the same name <i>Kemi</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0">From the whole of which Boerhaave gathers that
chemistry was thus originally denominated because
it was considered of old as “not fit to be
divulged to the populace, but treasured up as a
religious <i>secret</i>.”</p>

<p>If we are to credit Zozimus the Panopolite,
who is said to have lived about the beginning of
the fifth century, there were sound reasons for
thus treasuring up chemistry as a religious
secret, since, as it sprang from the <i>pretium
amoris</i>, its origin was not too reputable. “What
the divine writings relate is that the angels,
enflamed with the desire of women, instructed
’em in all the works and mysteries of nature.
For which indiscretion they were excluded heaven,
as having taught men things unfit for ’em
to know.” And Scaliger asserts that “Hermes
testifies as much; and all our learning, both open
and occult, confirms the account.” But who
Hermes was, adds that author, is hard to say,
for none of his writings has survived to our age,
“that lately published in Italy under the name
of <i>Hermes Trismegistus</i> being a manifest forgery.”</p>

<p>This legend of the “feministic” origin of chemistry
is in reality much older than the fifth century<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
of our era, and is but a variant of that
which, according to Jewish writers, led to the
expulsion of man from Paradise. A similar myth
was current among the Phœnicians, Persians,
Greeks, and Magi. We trace it in the legend of
Sibylla, who demanded, as the price of her favour
to Phœbus, not only length of years, but a
knowledge of the divine <i>arcanum</i>. Some of the
ecclesiastics who elaborated these myths are
particular in their accounts of the mysteries thus
imparted. They included the use of charms, a
knowledge of gold and silver and precious stones,
the art of dyeing, of painting the eyebrows,
etc.—the kind of <i>arcana</i>, in fact, which women
in all ages were presumably most keen to know.
It is, however, significant that in all allusions to
<i>chemia</i>, even after the translation of the seat of
the Roman Empire to Constantinople, it is implied
that a knowledge of it was a sacred mystery
to be known only to the priesthood, and jealously
guarded by them. It was characteristic of
writers who had affixed an eternal stigma on Eve
to make the sex in general answerable for an
illicit knowledge of “things unfit for men to
know.”</p>

<p>For, in reality, chemistry originated with men,
and it was not so much in the love of women as
of wine that it took its rise.</p>

<p>The manufacture of <i>alcohol</i> by processes of
fermentation is probably the oldest of the chemical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
arts. The word <i>wine</i> means, in fact, a <i>product
of fermentation</i>. Mosaic history relates that
Noah, soon after he got to dry land, “planted a
vineyard and drank of the wine,” with results
that would appear to show that the potency of
wine was not unfamiliar to him. Diodorus
Siculus, who studied Egyptian antiquities when
Egypt was a Roman province, states that the
ancient Egyptians ascribed the origin of wine to
Osiris. It was a sacrificial offering even in the
earliest times, as was bread. Wine seems to
have been prepared by the Chinese as far back
as the time of the Emperor Yü, <i>circa</i> 2220 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>
Beer was manufactured in Egypt in the time
of Senwosret <span class="smcap smaller">III.</span> (Sesostris) <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> 1880.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were skilled in dyeing and in
the manufacture of leather, and in the production
and working of metals and alloys. They
were familiar with the methods of tempering iron.
They made glass, artificial gems, and enamels.
The oldest known enamel was found as an amulet
on the Egyptian Queen Aahotep (1700 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>),
and glass beads were made before the time of
Thutmosis <span class="smcap smaller">III.</span> (1475 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>). The Jews knew of
gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin. Indeed,
it is through them and the Phœnicians, who were
among the earliest of traders, that Europe was
gradually made acquainted with many technical
products of Eastern origin.</p>

<p>The beginnings of the art of extracting and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
working of metals are lost in the mists of antiquity;
the chemistry of metals, indeed, has been
said to be almost coeval with mankind. Diodorus
Siculus found traditions in Egypt as to the
first inventor of metallurgical processes identical
with that of the son of Lamech and Zillah, Tubal-cain,
or Tuval-cain, of the Hebrews—the Vulcan
of the Romans.</p>

<p><i>Gold</i> was undoubtedly one of the earliest metals
to be made use of by men, as it probably was
one of the first to be discovered. It occurs free
in nature, and is met with in many rocks and in
the sands of rivers. Its colour, lustre, and density
would early attract attention to it; and its malleability
and ductility and the ease with which
it could be fashioned, together with its unalterability,
would render it valuable. Ethiopian
and Nubian gold were known from the earliest
times, and quartz crushing and gold washing
were practised by the Egyptians. Representations
of these processes have been found on
Egyptian tombs dating from 2500 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Gold-wire
was used by the Egyptians for embroidery, and
they practised plating, gilding, and inlaying as
far back as 2000 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span></p>

<p><i>Silver</i> also was employed by them, and appears,
like gold, to have been coined into money. It
was originally known as “white gold.” Some of
the oldest coins in existence are alloys of silver
and gold, obtained probably by the fusion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
naturally occurring argentiferous gold, such as
the pale gold of the Pactolus. Such an alloy
was termed <i>electrum</i>, from its resemblance in
colour to amber.</p>

<p><i>Copper</i> is also found to a limited extent in the
metallic state, but probably the greater part of
that used by the ancients was obtained from its
ores, which are comparatively abundant and
readily smelted. It was also used for coinage by
the Egyptians, and was fashioned by them into a
variety of utensils and implements. The older
writers drew no clear distinction between copper,
bronze, and brass, and the terms designating
them—<i>æs</i> and χαλκός—are frequently employed;
as by Pliny, indiscriminately. The statement in
Deut. viii. 9—“Out of whose hills thou mayest
dig brass”—obviously cannot mean an alloy
of copper and zinc, since this does not occur
naturally.</p>

<p>Pure copper is too soft a metal to be used for
swords and cutting instruments, but copper ores
frequently contain associated metals, as, for
example, tin, which would confer upon the
copper the necessary hardness to enable it to be
fashioned into weapons. Such copper would be
of the character of bronze, and it was known to
the early workers that the nature of the metal
was greatly modified by the selection of ores
from particular localities. It was comparatively
late in the metallurgical history of copper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
that bronze was produced by knowingly adding
tin to the metal.</p>

<p>Copper was largely used by the Romans,
who obtained it from Cyprus; it was known to
them as <i>æs Cyprium</i>, and eventually <i>Cuprum</i>,
whence we obtain the chemical symbol Cu.
What the Romans called <i>æs</i> was found also at
Chalkis, in Eubœa, whence χαλκός, the Greek
word for copper.</p>

<p><i>Aurichalcum</i>, or golden copper—that is,
brass—was well known to the early workers in
copper, and was made in Pliny’s time by heating
together copper, cadmia (calamine), and charcoal.</p>

<p>Bell metal was employed by the Assyrians, and
bronze was cast by the Egyptians for the manufacture
of mirrors, vases, shields, etc., as far back
as 2000 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> Statuary bronze, largely used by
the Romans, usually contained more or less
lead.</p>

<p><i>Tin</i>, which was also known to the early
Egyptians, would appear to have been first
obtained from the East Indies, and to have
been known under the Sanscrit name of
<i>Kastîra</i> (<i>Kâs</i>, to shine), whence we have the
Arabic word for tin, <i>Kàsdir</i>, and the Greek
κασσίτερος, used by Homer and Hesiod. Tin
ores are found in Britain (Cornwall), and were
brought thence by the Phœnicians. The group
of islands, including the Scilly Islands and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
the larger island to the east (Britain), was
known to the Romans as the <i>Insulæ Cassiterides</i>.</p>

<p>Pliny states that the tin is found in grains in
alluvial soil, from which it is obtained by washing;
but he gives no description of the method of
smelting. The Latin word for tin was <i>stannum</i>;
it was also known as <i>plumbum album</i>, in contradistinction
to lead, which was called <i>plumbum
nigrum</i>. Tin was used by the Romans for
covering the inside of copper vessels, and was
also occasionally employed in the construction
of mirrors.</p>

<p><i>Lead</i> was well known to the Egyptians. In
Pliny’s time it was mainly procured from Spain
and from Britain (Derbyshire). Leaden pipes
were used by the Romans for the conveyance
of water, and sheet lead was employed by
them for roofing purposes. The Romans were
also aware of alloys of lead and tin. <i>Argentarium</i>
was composed of equal parts of lead and
tin; <i>tertiarium</i>, used as a solder, consisted of two
parts of lead and one part of tin.</p>

<p><i>Iron</i>, although now the most important of the
common metals, was not in general use until
long after the discovery of gold, silver, and
copper. This was probably due to the fact that,
although its ores are relatively abundant and
widely distributed, its extraction as a metal
demanded greater skill and more appliances
than were possessed by the earlier races. Metallic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
iron was, however, well known to the Egyptians,
who employed it in the manufacture of
swords, knives, axes, and stone-chisels, both as
malleable iron and as steel. Steel was also
known to the Chinese as far back as 2220 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>,
and they were acquainted with the methods of
tempering it. The good quality of Chinese steel
caused it to be highly prized by Western nations.
The earliest people to smelt iron are supposed to
have been the Chalybes, a nation inhabiting the
neighbourhood of the Black Sea; it is from them
that the ancient name for steel—<i>chalybs</i>—is
derived, and also our word “chalybeate.”</p>

<p><i>Mercury</i> has long been known, but there is no
evidence that the ancient Egyptians were aware
of its existence, or it would probably have been
mentioned by Herodotus. It was familiar to
Aristotle, and its mode of manufacture from
cinnabar is described by Theophrastus (320 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>),
who terms it “liquid silver.” Processes of
amalgamation were known to Pliny, who notes
the readiness with which mercury dissolves gold.
Pliny appears to distinguish the native metal
found in Spain, which he terms <i>argentum vivum</i>
(quicksilver), from that obtained by sublimation
or distillation from cinnabar, which he calls
<i>hydrargyrum</i>, from which we get the chemical
symbol for mercury Hg.</p>

<p>A considerable number of metallic compounds
were known to the ancients, and were employed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
by them as medicines and as pigments. The
oxides of copper, known as <i>flos æris</i>, and <i>scoria
æris</i>, obtained by heating copper bars to redness
and exposing them to air, were used as escharotics.
Verdigris, or <i>ærugo</i>, was made by the same
methods as now. Blue vitriol, or <i>chalcantum</i>,
is described by Pliny, who says that the blue
transparent crystals are formed on strings suspended
in its solution.</p>

<p><i>Chrysocolla</i>, malachite, or copper carbonate,
was used as a green pigment. The blue κύανος of
the Greeks, or <i>cœruleum</i> of the Romans, was
obtained by fritting together alkali, sand, and
oxide of copper. <i>Botryitis</i>, <i>placitis</i>, <i>onychitis</i>,
<i>ostracitis</i>, were varieties of <i>cadmia</i> or oxide of
zinc, obtained by calcining calamine, and were
used in the treatment of ulcers, etc. <i>Molybdena</i>,
which was the Latin name for litharge, was
employed externally as an astringent and in the
manufacture of plaster. The lead plaster employed
by Roman surgeons was practically
identical in character and mode of preparation
with that in use to-day. <i>Cerussa</i>, or white lead,
was made as now by exposing sheets of lead to
the fumes of vinegar. It was used in medicine,
as a pigment, and in the preparation of cosmetics.
<i>Cerussa usta</i> was probably red lead. Its present
name of <i>minium</i> was originally applied to cinnabar,
the red sulphide of mercury, which was
frequently adulterated with red lead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
<i>Cinnabar</i>, formerly obtained from Africa, and,
by the Romans, from Spain, was also used
externally in medicine, and was a highly prized
pigment, whose value was known to the Chinese
from very early times. The black sulphide of
antimony, the <i>stimmi</i> and <i>stibium</i> of Dioscorides
and Pliny, was employed by women in Asia,
Greece, and latterly in Western Europe, and is
still so used in the East, for blackening their
eyelashes. Preparations of antimony were used
in medicine. <i>Realgar</i>, the scarlet sulphide of
arsenic, the <i>sandarach</i> of Aristotle, and the
<i>arrenichon</i> of Theophrastus, was employed as a
pigment, and also in medicine, both internally
and externally. The yellow sulphide of arsenic
or <i>auri pigmentum</i> (orpiment), was also used for
the same purposes.</p>

<p>A variety of yellow and red ochres, in addition
to the pigments above mentioned, were used by
painters, such as <i>rubrica</i>, an iron ochre of a dark
red colour, and <i>sinopis</i>, or reddle, obtained from
Egypt, Lemnos, and the Balearic Isles. Oxides
of manganese were used as brown pigments.
The white pigment, <i>paratonium</i>, was probably
meerschaum. <i>Melinum</i> was a variety of chalk
found in Samos. The ancients were well
acquainted with indigo and madder, and with
the method of manufacturing lakes, which was
employed by Grecian artists.</p>

<p>The famous <i>purpurissum</i> was chalk or clay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
stained by immersion in a solution of Tyrian
purple. <i>Atramentum</i> was lamp-black: ivory-black
was used by Apelles, and was known as
<i>elephantinum</i>. The ink of the ancients consisted
of lamp-black suspended in a solution of gum or
glue. The <i>atramentum indicum</i>, imported from
the East, was identical with China ink.</p>

<p>The ancients were well skilled in the art of
dyeing, and even of calico printing. The
Tyrians produced their famous purple dye as
far back as 1500 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span> It was obtained from
shell-fish, mainly species of Murex, inhabiting
the Mediterranean. Tyrian purple has been
shown to be dibrom-indigo, and to have been
produced by the action of air and light upon
the juices exuded from the shell-fish. The fine
linen of the Old Testament was probably cotton,
for the production of which Egypt was long celebrated.
That the Egyptians were acquainted with
the use of mordants seems evident from the following
passage from Pliny, quoted by <span class="locked">Thomson:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>There exists in Egypt a wonderful method of
dyeing. The white cloth is stained in various
places, not with dye stuffs, but with substances
which have the property of absorbing colours;
these applications are not visible upon the cloth,
but when they are dipped into a hot caldron
of the dye they are drawn out an instant after
dyed. The remarkable circumstance is that,
though there be only one dye in the vat, yet
different colours appear upon the cloth; nor
can the colour be afterwards removed.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
This passage accurately describes the process of
madder dyeing on cotton, whereby a variety of
fast colours—reds, browns and purples—can
be obtained from the same vat by the employment
of different mordants, such as alumina,
oxide of iron, or oxide of tin, etc.</p>

<p>Glass has been known from very early times.
Representations of glass-blowing were found
on the monuments of Thebes and Beni Hassan,
and large quantities of glass were exported to
Greece and Rome from Egypt, mainly by Phœnicians.
Aristophanes mentions it as <i>hyalos</i>,
and speaks of it as the beautiful transparent
stone used for kindling fire. The Egyptians
made use of various metallic oxides in colouring
glass. The <i>hæmatinon</i> of Pliny was a red
glass coloured with cuprous oxide. Cupric oxide
was used to colour glass green; and ancient blue
glass has been found to contain cobalt. The
costly <i>vasa murrhina</i> of the Romans, obtained
from Egypt, probably consisted of fluorspar,
identical with the Blue John of the Derbyshire
mines.</p>

<p>Stoneware has been made from time immemorial,
and the Chinese have manufactured
porcelain from very remote periods. Bricks and
tiles were made by the Romans, and mortar and
stucco were employed by the ancient Egyptians.</p>

<p>Soap (<i>sapo</i>) is mentioned by Pliny, but its
detergent properties were apparently unknown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
to him. It appears to have been first made by
the Gauls, who prepared it from the ashes of the
beech and the fat of goats, and used it as a
pomatum, as did the <i>jeunesse d’oreé</i> of Rome.
Wood ashes, as well as natron, were, however,
used by the ancients for their cleansing properties.</p>

<p>Starch, acetic acid, sulphur, alumen or crude
sulphate of alumina, beeswax, camphor, bitumen,
naphtha, asphalt, nitrum (carbonate of soda),
common salt, and lime, were all known to the
Egyptians, and were used by them for many
of the purposes in which they are employed
to-day.</p>

<p>It will be evident from this brief survey that
the ancients possessed a considerable acquaintance
with many operations of technical chemistry;
but, although they must necessarily have
accumulated a large amount of knowledge, very
little has come down to us concerning the mode
in which their processes were conducted, or as to
the precautions they employed to ensure uniform
results. Their methods were probably
jealously guarded and handed down by successive
members of the crafts as precious secrets.
The experienced masters of these crafts must
have met with many strange and perplexing
phenomena in the course of their operations, and
a spirit of inquiry must thereby at times have
been awakened. But, under the conditions in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
which their industries were prosecuted, the scientific
spirit was not free to develop, for science
depends essentially upon free intercommunication
of facts and the spread of knowledge of
natural phenomena. Moreover, the great intellects
of antiquity, for the most part, had little
sympathy with the operations of artisans, who,
at least among the Greeks and Romans, were,
for the most part, slaves. Philosophers taught
that industrial work tended to lower the standard
of thought. The priests, in most ages, have
looked more or less askance at attempts, on the
part of the laity, to inquire too closely into the
causes of natural phenomena. The investigation
of nature in early times was impossible
for religious reasons. There was an outcry in
Athens when the thunderbolts of Zeus were
ascribed to the collision of clouds. Anaxagoras,
Diogenes of Apollonia, Plato, Aristotle, Diagoras,
and Protagoras were charged by the priests
with blasphemy and driven into exile. Prodikos,
who deified the natural forces, as did
Empedokles the primal elements, was executed
for impiety. Sacerdotalism in Athens had no
more sympathy with science than had the Holy
Congregation in Italy when it banned the writings
of Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo, and sent
Giordano Bruno to the stake. The educated
Greeks had no interest in observing or in explaining
the phenomena of technical processes.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
However prone they might be to speculation,
they had no inclination to experiment or to
engage in the patient accumulation of the
knowledge of physical facts. “You Greeks,”
says Plato in one of his Dialogues, “are ever
children, having no knowledge of antiquity, nor
antiquity of knowledge!” The influence of a
spurious Aristotelianism, which lasted through
many centuries and even beyond the time of
Boyle, was wholly opposed to the true methods
of science, and it was only when philosophy had
shaken itself free from scholasticism that chemistry,
as a science, was able to develop.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Speculations</span> as to the origin and nature
of matter, and as to the conditions and forces
which affect it, are to be found, more or less
imperfectly developed, in the oldest systems of
philosophy of which we have any record. These
speculations are not based, in any real sense,
upon the systematic observation of natural
phenomena. Still, as they appealed to human
reason, they must be held to be founded upon
experience, or at least not to be consciously
inconsistent with it: All the oldest cosmogonies
regarded water as the fundamental principle of
things: from Okeanos sprang the gods—themselves
deified personifications of the “elements”
or principles of which the world was made.</p>

<p>In the course of time this doctrine of the
origin and essential nature of matter came to be
more particularly associated with the name of
Thales of Miletus, who lived six centuries before
our era, and who, according to Tertullian, is to
be regarded as the first of the race of the natural
philosophers—that is, the first of those who
made it their business to inquire after natural
causes and phenomena. Thales is known to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
have passed some years of his life in Egypt, and
to have been instructed in science by the priests
of Thebes and Memphis; and it is therefore
possible that he may have been influenced
by the Egyptian teaching in the formulation of
his cosmological theories.</p>

<p>It is significant of the tenacity with which the
mind clings to dogma and reveres authority that
the teaching of Thales should have survived
through the space of twenty-four centuries. It
can be shown to have affected the course of
chemical inquiry down to the close of the eighteenth
century. It influenced the experimental
labours of philosophers so diverse in character as
Van Helmont, Boyle, Boerhaave, Priestley, and
Lavoisier—all of whom made attempts to
prove or disprove its adequacy. Van Helmont,
indeed, was one of the most strenuous supporters
of the doctrine of Thales, and sought to establish
it by observations which, in the absence of all
knowledge of the true nature of air and water,
seemed at the time irrefutable. Perhaps the
one most frequently cited is his observation on
the growth of a plant which apparently had
no other form of sustenance than water. He
describes how he planted a willow weighing 5 lbs.
in 200 lbs. of earth previously dried in an oven.
The plant was regularly watered, when at the
end of five years it was found to weigh 169 lbs.
3 oz., whereas the earth, after redrying, had lost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
only 2 oz. in weight. Hence, 164 lbs. of woody
matter, leaves, roots, etc., had been produced
seemingly from water alone. More than a century
had to elapse before any clue to the true
interpretation of Van Helmont’s experiment
was gained. It was first furnished by the observations
of Ingenhousz and Priestley.</p>

<p>Although the idea of a primal “element” or
common principle is to be found in every
old-world philosophical system, the ancient
philosophers were by no means in agreement as
to its character. Anaximenes, who lived <i>circa</i>
500 <span class="smcap smaller">B.C.</span>, taught that it was air, Herakleitos of
Ephesus that it was fire, and Pherekides that
it was earth. The supposition that a single
primordial principle could be made to account
for all forms of matter and all the phenomena
and manifestations of the material world had
its difficulties. Attempts to group qualities as
principles, and to construct from these principles
the universe, were indeed made even prior to the
age of Thales. It was a comparatively simple
evolutionary step to regard these principles or
“elements” as mutually convertible. Anaximenes’
theory of the formation of rain was an
implicit admission of such convertibility. This
philosopher taught that rain came by the condensation
of clouds, which in their turn were
formed by the condensation of air. Everything
comes from air and everything returns to air.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
That water might be converted by fire into air
was surmised from the earliest times. Such a
supposition naturally sprung from the circumstance
that water was everywhere recognised to
disappear or to pass into the air under the
influence of fire or solar heat. The supposition
had grown into a fixed belief in the Middle Ages.
Even Priestley, as late as the end of the eighteenth
century, imagined for a time that he had
obtained proof of such a mutual conversion.
The possibility of the transmutation of water
into earth was a belief current through twenty
centuries, and was only definitely and finally
disproved by Lavoisier in 1770. The conception
of fire as the primal principle has its germ in the
fire- or sun-worship of the Chaldeans, Scythians,
Persians, Parsees, and Hindus, and it is not
difficult to trace, therefore, how heat came to
be regarded either as antecedent to, or as associated
with, the other primal principles. Empedokles,
apparently, was the first whose name
has come down to us to reintroduce the definite
conception of four primal elements—fire, air,
water, and earth. These he regarded as distinct,
and incapable of being transmuted, but as forming
all varieties of matter by intermixture in
various proportions. These principles he deified,
Zeus being the personification of the element of
fire, Here of air, Nestis of water, and Aidoneous
of earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
The doctrine of the four elements was also
adopted by Plato and amplified by Aristotle,
with whose name indeed it is commonly associated.
Aristotle, the greatest scientific thinker
among the Greeks, exercised an authority almost
supreme in Europe during nearly twenty centuries.
His influence is to be traced throughout
the literature of chemistry long after the time
of Boyle. It may be detected even now. Probably
few who write chemical memoirs to-day,
and who follow the time-honoured practice of
prefacing their own contributions to knowledge
by a statement of what is already known on the
subject, are aware that in so doing they are
obeying the injunctions of Aristotle. His theory
of the nature of matter is contained in his treatise
on <i>Generation and Destruction</i>. It mainly
differed from that of Empedokles in regarding
the four “elements” as mutually convertible.
Each “element” or principle was regarded as
being possessed of two qualities, one of which
was shared by another element or principle.</p>

<p>Thus: Fire is hot and dry; air is hot and wet;
water is cold and wet; earth is cold and dry.</p>

<p>In each primal “element” one quality prevails.
Fire is more hot than dry; air is more wet than
hot; water is more cold than wet; earth is more
dry than cold. The relative proportion and
mutual working of these qualities determined
the specific character of the “element.” Thus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
if the dryness of fire is overcome by the moisture
of water, air is produced; if the heat of air is
overcome by the coldness of earth, water is
formed; if the moisture of water is overcome
by the dryness of fire, earth results. Ancient
chemical literature contains many illustrations
or diagrams symbolising the convertibility or
mutual relations of the four “elements.”</p>

<p>It has been frequently stated that the influence
of the Peripatetic philosophy has been inimical
to the development of science. But, in reality,
the founder of that school, a descendant of
Esculapius, and undoubtedly one of the greatest
and most enlightened thinkers of antiquity, was
an ideal man of science. This is abundantly
evident from such of his works as can be proved
to be genuine. Much of what is called Aristotelianism
is entirely foreign to the spirit of the
teaching of Aristotle. The Aristotelians of the
Middle Ages were mainly dialecticians, and
almost wholly concerned with the formulæ of
syllogistic inference, and without real sympathy
with, or knowledge of, his system. Much, too,
that was attributed to him, and which was
venerated accordingly, is undoubtedly spurious.
The fame of the Master has consequently suffered
at the hands of those who, calling themselves
Peripatetics, were in no proper sense followers of
his method or interpreters of his dogma. Aristotle
affirmed that natural science can only be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
founded upon a knowledge of facts, and facts
can only be ascertained through observation
and experiment. He illustrates this particularly
by a reference to astronomy, “which,” he says,
“is based on the observation of astronomical
phenomena, and it is the case with every branch
of science or art.” It is erroneous and unjust,
therefore, to suppose that Aristotle’s philosophy,
as he taught it, is opposed to the true methods of
science.</p>

<p>A knowledge of Aristotle’s works was transferred
by Byzantine writers to Egypt; and, when
that land was overrun by the Arabs in the
seventh century, they adopted his system,
spreading it abroad wherever their conquests
extended. In the eighth century they carried
it into Spain, where it flourished throughout
their occupation of that country. From the
ninth to the eleventh century the greater part
of Europe was in a state of barbarism. The
Moslem caliphate in Spain, under the beneficent
rule of Jusuf and Jaküb, alone preserved science
from extinction. Cordova, Seville, Grenada,
and Toledo were the chief seats of learning in
Western Europe; and it was mainly through
“the perfect and most glorious physicist,” the
Moslem Ibn-Roshd—better known as Averroes—(1126–1198),
that Christian scholiasts like
Roger Bacon acquired their knowledge of the
philosophical system of Aristotle, and mainly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
through the Moslems Geber and Avicenna that
they gained acquaintance with the science of
the East.</p>

<p>The conception that matter is made up of
particles or <i>atoms</i>, and that these particles
are in a state of ceaseless motion, is to be
met with in Hindu and Phœnician philosophy.
It was taught by Anaxagoras, Leukippos, and
Demokritos to the Greeks, and by Lucretius to
the Romans. Leukippos and Demokritos explained
the creation of the world as due solely to
physical agencies without the intervention of a
creative intelligence. According to their theories,
the atoms are variable, not only in size,
but in weight. The smallest atoms are also
the lightest. Atoms are impenetrable; no two
atoms can simultaneously occupy the same place.
The collision of the atoms gives them an oscillatory
movement, which is communicated to adjacent
atoms, and these, in their turn, transmit
it to the most distant ones. Anaxagoras taught
that every atom is a world in miniature, and that
the living body is a congeries of atoms derived
from the aliments which sustain it. Plants are
living things, endowed like animals with respiratory
functions, and, like them, atomically
constituted. This philosopher was so far in
advance of his age that his countrymen accused
him of sacrilege, and he only escaped death by
flight. Further, the assumption that these atoms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
exert mutual attractions and repulsions is probably
as old as the fundamental conception itself.
At least, so far as can be traced, the conceptions
of atoms and atomic motion are indissolubly
connected. This is not the place to develop the
subsequent history of the doctrine of the atom,
nor need we now concern ourselves with the old
metaphysical quibble of its divisibility or indivisibility.
It may be, as Lucretius said, that the
original atom is very far down. It may be that
the physical atom is something which <i>is</i> not
divided, not something that <i>cannot</i> be divided.
This theory, dimly perceived in the mists of antiquity,
has grown and strengthened with the ages,
and in its modern application to the facts of
chemistry has acquired a precision and harmony
unimagined even by the poets and thinkers of
old. We shall see later how the whole course of
the science has been controlled, illumined, and
vivified by it. It is not too much to say that
the chemistry of to-day is one vast elaboration
of this primeval doctrine.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Alchemy</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">Although</span> the intellectual tendencies of the
Hellenic mind were hardly calculated to
favour the development of chemistry as a science,
the speculations of the Greeks concerning the
essential nature of matter and the mutual convertibility
of the “elements” led incidentally to
an extension of the art of operative chemistry.
This extension resulted from attempts to realise
what was the logical outcome of the teaching of
their philosophers—viz., the possibility of the
transmutation of metals. The idea of transmutation
has its germ in the oldest systems of
philosophy. It was a plausible doctrine, not
wholly unsupported by the phenomena of the
organic world; and it naturally commended
itself to men who were only too prone to adopt
what their cupidity and love of wealth predisposed
them to believe.</p>

<p>It has been assumed that alchemy at no time
in its history had the slightest claim to a philosophical
foundation, but that its professors and
adepts, even at the outset, consciously traded
on the credulity and greed of their dupes. Much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
may be urged against such a partial view. The
supposition is not consistent with history or
with evolutional tendencies. It may be, as
Davy once said, that “analogy is the fruitful
parent of error;” but the idea that metals could
be modified—could even be changed one into
the other—seemed to find support in innumerable
chemical phenomena well known but
imperfectly understood. The fact that alchemy—that
is the profession of making gold from
other metals—came to be practised by rogues is
no proof that it never had, and never could have
had, a philosophical basis.</p>

<p>The changes which substances experience
under the influence of fire, air, and water, or as
the result of their action on each other, are
frequently so profound that even the most superficial
of the early observers of chemical processes
could not fail to be impressed by them. Many
of these changes are, in fact, far more striking as
regards alteration in outward characters—such
as colour, lustre, density, etc.—than are the
differences between individual metals; say, between
lead and tin, or between tin and silver,
or between brass and gold. That copper ores, by
appropriate treatment with other ores, or that
copper itself by the addition of another metal,
could be made to furnish a metallic-looking
substance having certain of the attributes of
gold was known to the earliest workers in metals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
What is thought to be the oldest chemical
treatise in existence is a papyrus in the possession
of the University of Leyden. It consists of a
number of receipts for the working of metals and
alloys, and describes methods of imitating and
falsifying the noble metals. It explains how,
by means of arsenic, a white colour may be
given to certain metals, and how, by the addition
of cadmia, copper acquires the colour of gold.
The same papyrus describes a method of blackening
metals by the use of preparations of sulphur.
The limited knowledge of chemical
phenomena and of chemical processes which
these early workers necessarily possessed, so far
from precluding a belief in the possibility of
transmutation, actually encouraged it. As nothing
was known of the true nature of brass
or of its exact relation to copper, it was not
unreasonable to suppose that, if this substance
could be made to acquire <i>some</i> of the attributes
of gold by a process essentially chemical,
processes of a like nature might cause it to
acquire, if not <i>all</i>, at least so many of them as
to enable it to pass for gold of greater or less
fineness. To them, as to us, perfection was,
in technical practice, a question of degree: the
very language of the metallurgists of old was
in this respect nowise different from that of the
metallurgists of to-day.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to suppose that these early<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
attempts were deliberately and consciously
fraudulent, like those of coiners who knowingly
seek to make an alloy of lead and tin simulate
silver. The first alchemists sought in good faith
to make something which should be of the true
nature and essence of gold as they conceived it
to be. In fact, the idea of transmutation had
a rational foundation in a theory of the intrinsic
nature of metals which may be looked upon as a
development of the ancient beliefs concerning
the essential nature of all forms of matter.</p>

<p>Just as the Aristotelian “elements” were
qualities which, according to their degree, determined
the nature of substances, so, in like manner,
the specific character of a metal depended
upon the relative proportion of its “sulphur”
and “mercury.” These terms had no certain
reference to what we to-day understand by
sulphur and mercury. They denoted simply
qualities. The essence or “element” of mercury
conferred lustre, malleability, ductility, and
fusibility, or, speaking generally, the properties
which we connote as metallic; while to the
essence or “element” of sulphur was to be attributed
the combustibility—or, speaking
generally, the alterability—of the metal by fire.
By modifying the relative proportion of these
constituent elements, or by purifying them
from extraneous substances by the operations
of chemistry, it was conceived that the several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
metals could be changed one into the other. To
effect this purification it was necessary to add
various preparations known as “medicines,”
chief among which was the <i>Great Elixir</i>, or
<i>Magisterium</i>, or the <i>Philosopher’s Stone</i>, by
which the final transformation into the noblest
of the metals could alone be achieved.</p>

<p>The Arabic words <i>kímyâ</i> and <i>iksír</i> were originally
synonymous and each was used to denote
the agent by which the baser metals could be
transmuted into silver and gold. Ultimately
the former term became restricted to indicate
the art of transmutation (alchemy), whereas
<i>iksír</i>, or <i>al-iksír</i>, continued to denote the medium
by which the transmutation was effected.
By later writers the term was used to indicate
a liquid preparation—the <i>quintessence of the
philosophers</i>—whence we have the word <i>elixir</i>,
which always means a liquid.</p>

<p>The alchemistic theory of the compound nature
and mutual relations of the metals is usually
ascribed to Geber; but, although he adopted
it, he distinctly states that it did not originate
with him, but that he found it in the writings
of his predecessors.</p>

<p>The idea of the <i>stone</i>, the <i>philosophical powder</i>,
the <i>grand magisterium</i>, the <i>elixir</i>, the <i>tincture</i>,
the <i>quintessence</i>—by all of which terms the
transmuting medium is known in the literature
of alchemy—is probably connected with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
another conception respecting the origin of
metals which can be traced to very early times
and was prevalent throughout the Middle Ages.
It was supposed of old that metals were <i>generated</i>
within the earth, as animals and plants were
generated on its surface, and that something
akin to a seed, or semen, was needed to initiate
their formation. The great problem of alchemy
was to discover this fecundating substance, as
upon it depended the genesis of the perfect
metal. This idea of the conception of metals
runs through the literature of alchemy. It explains
many allusions and much of the terminology
of its writers. For example, the furnace
in which the alchemist makes his projection is
constantly spoken of as the <i>philosophical egg</i>.</p>

<p>It is impossible to say with certainty when
and where the art of alchemy originated. There
is no evidence that it has the antiquity which
certain of its adepts claimed for it. Oleus
Borrichius referred it to the time of Tubal-cain.
The earliest writers on alchemy were probably
Byzantine ecclesiastics, some of whom professed
to ascribe the art to Egypt, and eventually to
the mythological deity Hermes, whose association
with chemistry in such terms as “the hermetic
art,” “hermetically sealed,” etc., is thus
explained.</p>

<p>This much is established—that at some
period prior to the tenth century there arose a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
special class of operative chemists, for the most
part more learned in the knowledge of chemical
phenomena in general, and more skilled in chemical
manipulation, than the craftsmen and artisans
engaged in the manufacture of technical
products. They devoted themselves to searching
for methods whereby the common and baser
metals might be converted into silver and gold.
The first known definition of chemistry relates
to the aim and operations of this special class.
It occurs in the lexicon of Suidas, a Greek writer
of the eleventh century, who defines chemistry,
χημíα as the preparation of silver and gold. Attempts
at the artificial preparation of the noble
metals probably originated with the Arabians,
who followed the Egyptians and the Greeks in
the cultivation of chemical pursuits.</p>

<p>Neither Hesiod nor Homer makes mention of
the art of producing gold from any other metal,
or speaks of the universal medicine. Nor are they
referred to by Aristotle or by his pupil Theophrastus.
Pliny nowhere speaks of the philosopher’s
stone, although he tells the story of Caligula,
who, tempted by his avarice, sought to make
gold from orpiment (<i>auripigmentum</i>) by distillation.
“The result was that he did indeed obtain
both, and of the finest kind; but in so small
quantity, and with so much labour and apparatus,
that, the profit not countervailing the expense,
he desisted.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
According to Boerhaave, the first author who
mentions <i>al-chemia</i> is Julius Firmicus Maternus,
who lived under Constantine the Great, and who,
in his <i>Mathesis</i>, c. 15, speaking of the influences
of the heavenly bodies, affirms “that, if the
moon be in the house of Saturn when a child is
born, he shall be skilled in alchemy.”</p>

<p>The first writer who mentions the possibility
of transmuting metals would appear to be a
Greek divine called Æneas Garæus, who lived
towards the close of the fifth century, and who
wrote a commentary on Theophrastus. He was
followed by Anastatius the Sinaite, Syncellus,
Stephanus, Olimpiodorus; and, says Boerhaave,
“a crowd of no less than fifty more, all Greeks,
and most or all of them monks.” “The art
seemed now confined to the Greeks, and among
them few wrote but the religious, who from
their great laziness and solitary way of life
were led into vain, enthusiastical speculations,
to the great disservice and adulteration of the
art.... They all wrote in the natural style of
the Schoolmen, full of jargon, grimace, and obscurity.”</p>

<p>Experimental alchemy, as distinguished from
industrial chemistry, may, as already stated, be
said to have originated with the Arabians. At
first, alchemy was regarded as a branch of the
art of healing, and its professors were invariably
physicians who occupied themselves with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
preparation of chemical medicines. In fact, in
the beginning its true aim was regarded as that
which Paracelsus and the school of iatro-chemists
subsequently defined it to be. Under the
rule of the Caliphs the study of chemistry made
considerable progress, and its literature was
greatly augmented. The most notable name in
the history of chemistry during the eighth
century was <b>Abu-Moussah-Dschabir-Al-Sufi</b>—otherwise
<b>Geber</b>—(born 702, died 765), who
is stated to have been either a native of Mesopotamia,
or a Greek and a Christian, who afterwards
embraced Mahometanism, went to Asia,
and acquired a knowledge of Arabic. According
to Leo Africanus, a Greek who wrote of the
antiquity of the Arabs, Geber’s book was originally
written in Greek and translated thence into
Arabic, and he was not known by the name Geber,
which signifies a <i>great man</i> or a <i>prince</i>, till after this
version. Latin translations of what purported
to be his works were first published in the early
part of the sixteenth century, and an English
rendering appeared in 1678. According to this
it would seem that Geber regarded all the metals
as compounds of “sulphur” and “mercury,”
the differences between them depending upon the
relative proportion and degree of purity of these
constituents. He is said to have distinguished
them by the astrological names of the planets:
thus gold became <i>Sol</i>, silver <i>Luna</i>, copper <i>Venus</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
iron <i>Mars</i>, tin <i>Jupiter</i>, and lead <i>Saturn</i>. That
an occult connection of the metals with the stars
existed was part of the creed of alchemy, and
the influence of that belief is still traceable in
chemical, and especially in pharmaceutical,
literature; as, for example, in such terms as
<i>Lunar caustic</i>, <i>Martian preparations</i>, <i>Saturnine
solutions</i>, <i>etc.</i></p>

<p>It has been held that the idea of a universal
medicine had its origin with Geber. But this
may be due to a misreading of his words, which
in reality may have reference to the transmutation
of metals. He tells of a medicine which
cures all lepers. But this may be nothing but
allegory. By <i>man</i> is probably meant gold, and
by <i>lepers</i> the other metals; and the medicine is
the universal solvent or agent which transmutes.
Alchemistic literature is full of allegories of this
character. Berthelot has shown that in reality
there were two Gebers—one who is generally
considered to be of Arab origin, and another
whose identity is not established, but who was
probably a Western European who appears to
have lived about the year 1300.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> There is very little doubt that the work of “Phileletha,”
which professed to be taken from an “Uhralten
MS.” preserved in the Vatican Library, entitled <i>Geberi
des Königes der Araber</i>, and published by Hieron.
Philipp. Nitschel, Frankfurth and Leipzig, in 1710, is
spurious.</p></div>

<p>Other notable names in the history of Arabian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
alchemy are <b>Rhazes</b>, or <b>Abû Bakr
Mohammed ibn Zakaráyá el-Rázi</b>, who lived
<i>circa</i> 925, and <b>Avicenna</b>, or in Arabic <b>Abû Ali
el-Hosein ibn-Abdallah ibn-Sina</b>, born 980,
died 1037. The former, a Persian, practised
medicine at Baghdad as a follower of Galen and
Hippocrates. The latter, one of the most
eminent of Moslem physicians and a voluminous
writer, was a native of Bokhara. He is mainly
known in the history of science by his <i>Canon of
Medicine</i>, in which he describes the composition
and preparation of remedies. He wrote at
least one treatise on alchemy, but others attributed
to him are probably apocryphal. Of his
<i>Philosophia Orientalis</i>, mentioned by Roger
Bacon and Averroes, no trace remains.</p>

<p>Although it is reasonably certain that the
alchemists of the time of Geber and of his successors
had a considerable acquaintance with
manipulative chemistry, there were so many
impudent literary forgeries during the alchemical
period that the precise extent of the knowledge
possessed by the early chemists must always
remain uncertain.</p>

<p>A number of the ordinary chemical processes,
such as distillation, sublimation, calcination,
filtration, appear to have been known to, and
to have been commonly practised by, the Arabian
chemists; and many saline substances, such
as carbonate of soda, pearlash, sal-ammoniac,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
alum, copperas, borax, silver nitrate, cinnabar,
and corrosive sublimate, were prepared by them.
They seem to have known of certain of the
mineral acids, and were familiar with the solvent
properties of <i>aqua regia</i>.</p>

<p>An examination of the literature of alchemy
serves to show how its principles and tenets
developed. The philosopher’s stone is first
heard of in the twelfth century. Prior to that
period the greater number of the Greek and
Arabian writers contented themselves with
affirming the fact of transmutation, without
indicating how it might be accomplished. The
universal medicine and the elixir of life were the
products of a later age; no mention of them is
known before the thirteenth century.</p>

<p>Alchemy flourished vigorously during the
Middle Ages, and lingered on even until the
early part of the nineteenth century. Its history
is simply a long chapter in the history of
human credulity. For the most part it is a
record of self-deception, imposture, and fraud.
It produced an abundant literature, mainly the
work of ecclesiastics, between the seventh and
fourteenth centuries; but as regards the artificial
preparation of the noble metals or the discovery
of the universal medicine or the elixir of life it
was barren of result.</p>

<p>Although no clear line of demarcation is possible,
it may be convenient, in dealing with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
personal history of alchemy, to divide it into the
two periods before and after Paracelsus, since
under his inspiration and example alchemy
underwent a great development as regards its
professed objects. These eventually became so
extravagant that, wide as are the limits of human
credulity, its pretensions gradually brought it
into disrepute, and it fell by the weight of its own
absurdities.</p>

<p>One of the most reputable of the early Western
alchemists was <b>Albert Groot</b>, or <b>Albertus
Magnus</b>, born at Lauingen in 1193. He was a
Dominican monk, who became Bishop of Regensburg,
but, resigning his bishopric, retired to a
convent at Cologne, where he devoted himself
to science until his death in 1282. He is credited
with having written a number of chemical
tracts, for the most part in clear and intelligible
language, which is more than can be said of the
greater portion of alchemistical literature. He
gives an account of the origin and main properties
of the chemical substances known in his
time, and describes the apparatus and processes
used by chemists, such as the water-bath, alembics,
aludels, and cupels. He speaks of cream
of tartar, alum and caustic alkali, red lead,
liver of sulphur and arsenic, green vitriol and
iron pyrites.</p>

<p>Contemporaneously with him was <b>Roger
Bacon</b>, <i>Doctor Mirabilis</i>, one of the most erudite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
men of his age, who was born near Ilchester in
Somerset in 1214, and, after studying at Oxford,
became a friar, occupied himself in philosophical
pursuits, and wrote numerous tracts on alchemy.
He describes what was probably gunpowder,
but there is no certain proof that he invented it.
In his <i>De Secretis Artis et Naturæ</i>, written before
1249, he gives instructions for refining saltpetre,
and in an anagram which Colonel Hime, in his
<i>Gunpowder and Ammunition</i>, has interpreted,
he states that a mixture “which will produce a
thundering noise and a bright flash” may be
made by taking “7 parts of saltpetre, 5 of young
hazel wood, and 5 of sulphur.” He died in 1285.</p>

<p><b>Raymund Lully</b>, a friend and scholar of
Bacon, was born in Majorca in 1225 (others say
1235), and was buried there in 1315. A member
of the Order of Minorites, he had a great reputation
as an alchemist; and a number of books on
alchemy and chemical processes are ascribed to
him. He described modes of obtaining nitric
acid and aqua regia, and studied their action
upon metals. He obtained alcohol by distillation,
and knew how to dehydrate it by the aid
of carbonate of potash, which he obtained by
calcining cream of tartar. He prepared various
tinctures and essential oils, and a number of
metallic compounds, such as red and white
precipitate. To him is usually ascribed the first
idea of a universal medicine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
There is some difficulty in believing that all
that is ascribed to Lully was actually the work
of his age, for it would appear to have been a
common practice with the disciples and followers
of a notable scholar to usher in their performances
under their master’s name—a practice
not unknown in later days. “So full are they of
the experiments and observations which occur in
our later writers that either the books must be
suppositious, or the ancient chemists must have
been acquainted with a world of things which
pass for the discoveries of modern practice”
(Boerhaave). The story is that Lully plunged
into the study of chemistry from the desire to
cure a maiden of a cancered breast, and that he
was stoned to death in Africa, whither he had
journeyed as a missionary. It has been further
alleged that at one period of his life he made gold
in the Tower of London by the King’s order, and
that he offered Edward III. a supply of six
millions to make war against the infidels. As
Boerhaave drily remarks, “the history of this
eminent adept is very much imbroiled.”</p>

<p><b>Arnoldus Villanovanus</b>, or <b>Arnaud de Villeneuve</b>,
a Frenchman, is said to have been born
in 1240, and to have practised medicine in
Barcelona, where he incurred the enmity of the
Church by reason of his heretical opinions, and
was obliged to leave Spain. He led a wandering
life, eventually settling in Sicily, under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
protection of Frederick II., and acquired a great
reputation as a physician. Summoned thence
by Clement V., who lay sick at Avignon, he
lost his life by shipwreck in 1313.</p>

<p><b>Johannes de Rupecissa</b>, or <b>Jean de Raquetaillade</b>,
a Franciscan friar who lived from
about the middle to the end of the fourteenth
century, wrote a number of treatises on alchemy,
and described methods of making calomel and
corrosive sublimate. He was accused of the
practice of magic, and, by order of Innocent VI.,
was thrown into prison, where he died. He was
buried at Villefranche.</p>

<p><b>George Ripley</b>, an Englishman, Canon of
Bridlington, practised alchemy during the second
half of the fifteenth century. He spent some
time in Italy in the service of Innocent VIII.
On his return to England he became a Carmelite,
and died in 1490. Like Bacon, he was charged
with magic. According to Mundanus, he followed
alchemy with such success that he was able
to advance to the knights of St. John of Jerusalem
large amounts of gold for the defence of the Isle
of Rhodes against the Turks.</p>

<p>One of the most important names in connection
with the history of alchemy is that of <b>Basil
Valentine</b>. Of his personal history nothing is
known. He was supposed to be a Benedictine
monk who lived in Saxony during the latter half
of the fifteenth century; but there are grounds<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
for the belief that the numerous writings attributed
to him are in reality the work of various
hands. The attempt made by Maximilian I.
to discover the identity of the author was unavailing,
nor have subsequent inquiries had any
better result. The collection of books bearing
his name, first published in the beginning of the
seventeenth century, reveals quite a remarkable
number of chemical facts up to that time not
generally known. The most important of these
relate to antimony and its preparations, such as
butter of antimony, powder of algaroth, oxide of
antimony, etc. He seems to have known of
arsenic, zinc, bismuth, and manganese. He
described a number of mercurial preparations,
and many of the salts of lead were known to him.
He mentions fulminating gold, and was aware
that iron could be coated with copper by immersion
in a solution of blue vitriol. He knew of
green vitriol and the double chloride of iron and
ammonium, and gave the modes of making a
considerable number of other metallic salts,
such as the <i>sal armoniacum</i>, which we now
know as sal ammoniac. He also appears to
have prepared ether and the chloride and nitrate
of ethyl.</p>

<p>There is reason to believe, as stated already,
that many of the published works ascribed to
these learned men are the work of obscure individuals
who traded on their fame. What may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
with certainty be credited to them serves to
show that their theoretical opinions had much
in common. They all regarded the transmutation
of metals and the existence of the philosopher’s
stone as facts which could not be controverted.
They followed Geber in assuming that
all the metals were essentially compound in
their nature, and consisted of the essence or
“element” of mercury, united with different
proportions of the essence or “element” of
sulphur.</p>

<p>The alchemists were the professional chemists
of their time, and many of them were practising
physicians. Indeed, professional chemistry may
be said to have originated out of the practice of
physic. As the number of chemical products
increased and their value in therapeutics became
more and more appreciated, there arose another
school of alchemists, whose energies were devoted,
not to the transmutation of metals—which,
however plausible as a belief, seemed
hopeless of achievement—but to the more
immediate practical benefits which it was recognised
must follow from the closer association of
chemistry and medicine. This school came to be
known as the iatro-chemists. As their doctrines
exercised a great influence upon the development
of chemistry, it will be desirable to treat of them
and their professors in a special chapter.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Philosopher’s Stone</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">During</span> the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth
centuries the cult of alchemy attained
to the dignity of a religion. Belief in transmutation
and in the virtues and powers of the philosopher’s
stone, in the universal medicine, the
alkahest, and the elixir of life, formed its articles
of faith. The position it acquired was due to
some extent to the attitude towards it of the
Romish Church. Many reputable bishops and
fathers were professed alchemists; and chemical
laboratories, as in the Egyptian temples, were to
be found in monasteries throughout Christendom.
Pope John XXII., who had a laboratory in his
palace at Avignon, is the reputed author of a
work, <i>Ars Transmutatoria</i>, published in 1557.
But to a still larger extent it was due to the fact
that alchemy appealed to some of the strongest
of human motives—the wish for health, the
fear of death, and the love of wealth. It was a
cunningly devised system, which exploited the
foibles and frailties of human nature. The
policy of the Church, however, it should be said,
was not consistently and uniformly favourable to
alchemy. Its practices occasionally came under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
the papal ban, although at times, to suit the
exigencies of Christian princes, the interdict was
removed. Theosophy and mysticism were first
imported into alchemy, not by Arabs, but by
Christian workers. The intimate association of
religion with alchemy during the Middle Ages is
obvious in the writings of Lully, Albertus
Magnus, Arnaud de Villeneuve, Basil Valentine,
and other ecclesiastics. Invocations to divine
authority are freely scattered over their pages.
Even the lay alchemist professed to rule his life
and conduct by the example and precepts of the
good Bishop of Regensburg. He was directed
to be patient, assiduous, and persevering; discreet
and silent; to work alone; to shun the
favour of princes and nobles, and to ask the
divine blessing on each operation of trituration,
sublimation, fixation, calcination, solution, distillation,
and coagulation.</p>

<p>Although alchemy, at least in its decadent
days, lived for the most part by its appeal to
some of the lowest instincts of mankind, and is
only worth notice as a transient phase in the
history of science, a few details concerning the
tenets and practices of its professors may be of
interest to the curious reader. And first as regards
the nature of the philosopher’s stone—the
grand magistery, the quintessence. Many
alchemists professed to have seen and handled
it. It is usually described as a red powder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
Lully mentions it under the name of <i>Carbunculus</i>.
Paracelsus says that it was like a ruby,
transparent and brittle as glass; Berigard de
Pisa that it was of the colour of a wild poppy,
with the smell of heated sea salt; Van Helmont
that it was like saffron, with the lustre of glass.
Helvetius describes it as of the colour of sulphur.
Lastly, an unknown writer, under the pseudonym
of “Kalid,” says that it may be of any colour—white,
red, yellow, sky-blue, or green. As the
substance was wholly mythical, a certain latitude
of description may reasonably be expected.
Some of the alchemists were of opinion that the
magistery was of two kinds—the first, the
<i>grand</i> magistery, needed for the production of
gold; the second, the <i>small</i> magistery, only capable
of ennobling a metal as far as the stage of
silver. Then, as to the amounts required to
effect a transmutation, accounts are equally
discrepant. Arnaud de Villeneuve and Rupescissa
assert that one part of the grand magistery
will convert a hundred parts of a base metal into
gold; Roger Bacon, a hundred thousand parts;
Isaac of Holland, a million. Raymond Lully
states that philosopher’s stone is of such power
that even the gold produced by means of it will
ennoble an infinitely large amount of a base
metal.</p>

<p>It is hardly necessary to state that a preparation
of such potency is capable of effecting anything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
or everything; and accordingly, as time
went on, other attributes than that of transmutation
came to be associated with it. It may
be, as Boerhaave surmises, that the idea of a
universal medicine had its origin in a too literal
interpretation of Geber’s allegory of the six
lepers. Be this as it may, during the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries the philosopher’s stone
was gravely prescribed as a means of preserving
health and prolonging life. In case of illness
one grain was directed to be dissolved in a sufficient
quantity of good white wine, contained in a
silver vessel, the draught to be taken after midnight.
Recovery would follow after an interval
depending upon the severity and age of the
complaint. To keep in good health, the dose
was to be repeated at the beginning of spring and
autumn. “By this means,” says Daniel Zacharias,
“one may enjoy perfect health until the
end of the days assigned to one.” Isaac of Holland
and Basil Valentine are equally explicit, but
in their case it is recommended that the dose
should be taken once a month: thus life would be
prolonged “until the supreme hour fixed by the
king of heaven.” Other alchemists were not
always so prudent in prophecy. Artephius gave
the limit of human life thus prolonged as a thousand
years; Gualdo, a Rosicrucian, was stated
to have lived four hundred years. Raymond
Lully and Salomon Trismosin, we are told, renewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
their youth by means of it. The advanced
age at which Noah begat children could
only be due, says Vincent de Beauvais, to his
use of the philosopher’s stone. Dickinson wrote
a learned book to prove that the great age of the
patriarchs was owing to the same secret.</p>

<p>But not only were health and length of days
the fortunate lot of him who possessed the philosopher’s
stone; increase of wisdom and virtue
equally followed from its use. As it ennobled
metals, so it freed the heart from evil. It made
men as wise as Aristotle or Avicenna, sweetened
adversity, banished vain-glory, ambition, and
vicious desires. Adam received it at the hands
of God, and it was given also to Solomon, although
the commentators were rather exercised
to know why, as he possessed the philosopher’s
stone, he should have sent to Ophir for gold.</p>

<p>It would serve no good purpose to attempt to
describe the recipes given by various alchemists
to prepare this precious substance. With an
affectation at times of precision, they were
purposely obscure, and always enigmatical. As
Boyle said of them, they could scarcely keep
themselves from being confuted except by keeping
themselves from being clearly understood.
One example of their recipes must suffice: “To
fix quicksilver.—Of several things take 2, 3 and
3, 1; 1 to 3 is 4; 3, 2 and 1. Between 4 and 3
there is 1; 3 from 4 is 1; then 1 and 1, 3 and 4;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
1 from 3 is 2. Between 2 and 3 there is 1, between
3 and 2 there is 1. 1, 1, 1, and 1, 2, 2 and
1, 1 and 1 to 2. Then 1 is 1. I have told you
all.” No wonder, after an equally luminous
explication, a pupil of Arnaud de Villeneuve
should have exclaimed: “But, master, I do not
understand.” Upon which the master rejoined
that he would be clearer another time.</p>

<p>Nor is it necessary to dilate upon the other
virtues which were ascribed at various times to
the philosophical powder, as, for example, its
power of making pearls and precious stones, or of
its use in preparing the <i>alkahest</i>, or universal solvent,
invented by Paracelsus. In their attempts
to fathom the depths of human credulity the
alchemists at length over-reached themselves.
The idea of a universal solvent carried with it, as
Kunkel pointed out, its own refutation: if it dissolved
everything, no vessel could contain it.
And yet, says Boerhaave, a whole library could
be filled with writings by the school of Paracelsus
on the alkahest. From the latter end of the
sixteenth century repeated attempts were made
to expose the pretensions and demonstrate the
absurdities of alchemy. Among its adversaries
may be cited Thomas Erastius, Hermann
Conringius, and the Jesuit Kircher. Many of
their dupes, potentates and princes who were
powerful enough to exercise it, occasionally visited
with their vengeance those who, unmindful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
of the injunctions of Albert the Great, had
traded too long upon their credulity. The
Emperor Rudolph II., who earned the title of
“The Hermes of Germany,” was a zealous cultivator
of alchemy, and had a well-equipped
laboratory in his palace at Prague, to which
every adept was welcome. Ferdinand III. and
Leopold I. were also patrons of the hermetic art,
as were Frederick I. and his successor, Frederick
II., Kings of Prussia. Indeed, at one period
nearly every Court in Europe had its alchemist,
with the privileges of the Court fool or the poet
laureate. The fraud and imposture to which
the practice gave rise led occasionally to the
promulgation of stringent laws against it, and
at times the pursuit of operative chemistry became
well-nigh impossible in some countries.
In the fifth year of the reign of Henry IV. (1404)
it was enacted that “None from henceforth shall
use to multiply gold or silver, or use the craft of
multiplication; and if the same do he shall
incur the pain of felony.” According to Watson,
the true reason for passing this Act was not an
apprehension that men should ruin their fortunes
by endeavouring to make gold, but a
jealousy lest Government should be above asking
aid of the subject. At the same time, letters
patent were granted to several persons, permitting
them to investigate the universal medicine
and perform the transmutation of metals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
Alphonse X., of Castille, the author of the
<i>Key of Wisdom</i>, practised alchemy. Henry VI.,
of England, and Edward IV. had dealings with
adepts. Even Elizabeth Tudor, who was a
shrewd enough sovereign, had the notorious Dr.
Dee in her pay. Charles VII. and Charles IX., of
France, Christian IV., of Denmark, and Charles
XII., of Sweden, sought to replenish their exhausted
treasuries by the aid of the philosopher’s
stone. If princes eventually learned
not to put their trust in alchemists, alchemists
learned equally to their cost not to put their
trust in princes. Duke Julius, of Brunswick, in
1575, burnt a female alchemist, Marie Ziglerin,
who had failed in her promise to furnish him with
a prescription for the making of gold. David
Benther killed himself to escape the fury of the
Elector Augustus, of Saxony. Bragadino was
hanged at Munich in 1590 by the Elector of
Bavaria. Leonard Thurneysser, who gained an
evil notoriety in his day as one of the most
unscrupulous of the followers of Paracelsus, and
who amassed considerable wealth by the sale of
cosmetics and nostrums, was deprived of his ill-gotten
gains in 1584 by the Elector of Brandenburg,
and died in misery in the convent. Borri,
a Milanese adventurer, who had deceived
Frederick III., of Denmark, was imprisoned for
years by that monarch, and died in captivity in
1695. William de Krohnemann was hanged by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
the Margrave of Byreuth, who, with grim irony,
caused the inscription to be fixed to his gibbet:
“I once knew how to fix mercury, and now
I am myself fixed.” Hector de Klettenberg was
beheaded in 1720 by Augustus II., King of
Poland.</p>

<p>All the followers of Hermes were not so wary
or so candid as the artist who declined an invitation
to visit the Court of Rudolph II., saying:
“If I am an adept, I have no need of the
Emperor; if I am not, the Emperor has no need
of me.” Well might John Clytemius, Abbot of
Wiezenberg, write: “<i>Vanitas, fraus, dolus, sophisticatio,
cupiditas, falsitas, mendacium, stultitia,
paupertas, desesperatio, fuga, proscriptio et mendicitas,
perdisæque sunt chemiæ</i>.”</p>

<p>Despite the attacks of Kunkel, Boerhaave,
the elder Geoffroy, Klaproth, and other chemists
of influence and repute, alchemy died hard. It
found believers in England until near the close
of the eighteenth century, and was professed
even by a Fellow of the Royal Society—Dr.
James Price, of Guildford, who, in chagrin at the
exposure of his pretensions, put an end to his
existence in 1783. Hermetic societies existed in
Westphalia, at Königsberg, and at Carlsruhe
down to the first decade of the nineteenth century.
M. Chevreul, who lived well into that
century, relates that he knew of several persons
who were convinced of the truth of alchemy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
among them “generals, doctors, magistrates,
and ecclesiastics.” The strange medley of alchemy,
theosophy, thaumaturgy, and cabalisticism
professed by Christian Rosenkreuz is not
without its adherents, even in this twentieth
century.</p>

<p>If the baser metals have not been made to
furnish gold, truth at least has followed from
the practice of error. This is the only transmutation
which the art of Hermes has succeeded
in effecting. To err is human. Although alchemy
is not without its special interest as one of
the most remarkable aberrations in the history
of science, some of its practitioners, it must be
admitted, deceived only themselves: if misguided,
they were at least honest, and pursued
their calling in a settled conviction of the soundness
of their faith. Although they never reached
their goal—the discovery of the Philosopher’s
Stone and the Elixir of Life—their labours were
not wholly vain, for many new and unexpected
facts came to light as the result of their assiduity.</p>

<p>“Credulity in arts and opinions,” wrote Lord
Bacon in <i>De Augmentis Scientiarum</i>,</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0">is likewise of two kinds—viz., when men give
too much belief to arts themselves, or to certain
authors in any art. The sciences that sway the
imagination more than the reason are principally
three—viz., astrology, natural magic,
and alchemy.... Alchemy may be compared
to the man who told his sons that he had left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
them gold, buried somewhere in his vineyard;
while they by digging found no gold, but by
turning up the mould about the roots of the
vines procured a plentiful vintage. So the
search and endeavours to make gold have
brought many useful inventions of light.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> term “iatro-chemistry” denotes a particular
phase in the history of medicine and
of chemistry. The iatro-chemists were a school
of physicians who sought to apply chemical
principles to the elucidation of vital phenomena.
According to them, human illnesses result from
abnormal chemical processes within the body,
and these could only be counteracted by appropriate
chemical remedies. Although this idea
did not originate with him, the chief exponent
of this school is commonly said to be Paracelsus.</p>

<p>A man of violent passions, coarse, drunken,
arrogant, and unscrupulous, <b>Philippus Aureolus
Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombastus von Hohenheim</b>—to
give him his full name—would seem
to have possessed none of the attributes needed
by the successful leader of an intellectual
revolution.</p>

<p>Born at Etzel in Switzerland in 1493, son
of a physician, William Bombast von Hohenheim,
who combined the practice of astrology
with that of alchemy, Paracelsus, even as a
youth, became a wanderer, passing from province
to province and cloister to cloister, living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
by telling fortunes and practising sometimes as a
quack and at other times as an army surgeon,
and gaining, as he tells us, much curious information
from old women, gipsies, conjurers, and
chemists. If we may trust his own account of
himself, he had, before he was thirty-three, wandered
over the whole of Europe, and even into
Africa and Asia, everywhere performing miraculous
cures and constantly getting into trouble.
In 1526 he secured the appointment of Professor
of Physic in the University of Basle, and signalised
his occupancy of the chair by a course of
lectures—a farrago of confused German and
barbarous Latin—in which he assailed with
extraordinary vigour and unexampled coarseness
the medical system of the school of Galen.
Scandalised as his professional brethren might
be, Paracelsus expressed, intentionally or unintentionally,
the feeling of impatience with which
the laity viewed a system of therapeutics based
only on tradition. In this revolt against authority
he initiated a movement which, whatever
might have been its influence on medicine, served
eventually, under the guidance of worthier men,
to emancipate chemistry from the thraldom of
alchemy.</p>

<p>Paracelsus did little more than initiate. Although
his many tracts show that he was familiar
with nearly every chemical preparation of
his time, many of which he used in his practice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
he added no new substance to science. A man
of great ability and extraordinary talent, he
squandered his powers in dissipation. His intemperate
conduct soon lost him his chair at
Basle; and, after an ignoble quarrel with the
magistracy, he fled the town, and, resuming his
wandering life, died, under wretched circumstances,
at Salzburg, in his forty-eighth year.</p>

<p>Space will not permit of any account of the
philosophical opinions of Paracelsus—of his
mysticism, his theosophy, his pantheism, his
extraordinary doctrine of the Archæus and
Tartarus, his association of astrology with medicine.
His chief merit lies in his insistence that
the true function of chemistry was not to make
gold artificially, but to prepare medicines and
substances useful to the arts. He thereby made
chemistry indispensable to medicine, and thenceforward
chemistry began to be taught in the
universities and in the schools as an essential
part of a medical education.</p>

<p>Paracelsus is usually regarded as a typical
alchemist—the kind of man made familiar to
us by the paintings of Teniers, Van Ostade, and
Stein—a boorish, maudlin knave, who divided
his time between the pothouse and the kitchen
in which he prepared his extracts, simples, tinctures,
and the other nostrums which he palmed
off upon a credulous world, as ignorant and
superstitious as himself. There is much in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
personal history of Paracelsus that serves to
justify such a view of him. That he was in the
main an impudent charlatan, ignorant, vain, and
pretentious, there can be little doubt. He had
an astonishing audacity and a boundless effrontery;
and it was largely by the exercise of these
qualities that he secured such professional success
as he enjoyed.</p>

<p>To judge from the number of the published
works associated with his name, he was an active
and industrious writer. Considering that
during the greater part of his waking time he
was more or less intoxicated, it is difficult to
conceive what opportunity he had for composing
them. Only one or two are known to be genuine.
These, according to Operinus, his publisher, he
dictated; and from their incoherence and obscurity,
their mystical jargon, and misuse of
terms, they read like the ravings of one whom
drunkenness had deprived of reason. Many of
the tracts and larger works appeared after his
death—some of them years after; and there is
no certain proof that he was the actual author.
Even if we regard them as suppositious, the
fact that they should be published under his
name is significant of the influence and notoriety
which this extraordinary man succeeded in
achieving during his short and chequered career.</p>

<p>The immediate followers of Paracelsus—among
whom may be named Thurneysser, Dorn,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
Severinus, Duchesne—distinguished themselves
only by the boldness with which they
promulgated his doctrines, and the unscrupulous
use which they made of his methods. They were
all zealous anti-Galenists, who professed to believe
that the sum and perfection of human knowledge
was to be found in the Cabala, and that
the secrets of magical medicine were contained
in the Apocalypse. They adopted pantheism
in all its grossness: everything that exists eats,
drinks, and voids excrement; even minerals and
liquids assimilate food, and eliminate what they
do not incorporate. Sylphs inhabit the air,
nymphs the water, pigmies the earth, and salamanders
the fire. Thus even the Aristotelian
elements were animated. Mercury, sulphur,
and salt were, according to Paracelsus, the primal
principles which entered into the composition
of all things, material and immaterial, visible
and invisible. The following so-called “harmonies”
were essential articles of faith with a
<span class="locked">Paracelsian:—</span></p>

<table class="narrow lrpad intact" summary="harmonies">
  <tr>
    <td>Soul</td>
    <td>Spirit</td>
    <td>Body</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Mercury</td>
    <td>Sulphur</td>
    <td>Salt</td></tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Water</td>
    <td>Air</td>
    <td>Earth</td></tr>
</table>

<p class="in0">The laws of the Cabala were held to explain the
functions of the body. The sun rules the heart,
the moon the brain, Jupiter the liver, Saturn the
spleen, Mercury the lungs, Mars the bile, Venus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
the kidneys. Gold was a specific against diseases
of the heart; the liquor of Luna (solution
of silver) cures diseases of the brain. “The
remedies,” said Paracelsus, “are subjected to
the will of the stars, and directed by them.
You ought, therefore, to wait until heaven is
favourable before ordering a medicine.”</p>

<p>The Paracelsian physicians, for the most part,
were a set of dangerous fanatics, who, in their contempt
for the principles of Hippocrates, Galen,
and Avicenna, and in their reckless use of
powerful remedies, many of them metallic poisons,
wrought untold misery and mischief. The
inevitable reaction set in, and certain of the
faculties, particularly that of Paris, prohibited
their licentiates, under severe penalties, from
using chemical remedies. It is not to be supposed,
however, that all iatro-chemists were
unscrupulous charlatans. Some of them clearly
perceived the significance and true value of the
movement which Paracelsus may be credited
with having originated.</p>

<p><b>Andreas Libavius</b>, or Libau, originally a physician,
born in Halle, is best known by his
<i>Alchymia</i>, published in 1595, which contains an
account of the main chemical facts known in his
time, and is written in clear and intelligible language,
in strong contrast to the mystery and
obscurity of his predecessors. He was the
discoverer of stannic chloride, still known as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
fuming liquor of Libavius, and described a
method of preparing oil of vitriol in principle
identical with that now made use of on a manufacturing
scale. He died in 1616.</p>

<p><b>John Baptist van Helmont</b>, a scion of a noble
Brabant family, was born in Brussels in 1577.
After studying philosophy and theology at the
University of Louvain, he directed his attention
to medicine, and made himself familiar, in turn,
with every system from Hippocrates to Paracelsus.
Having spent some time in travel, he
settled on his estate at Vilvorde, and occupied
himself with laboratory pursuits until his death
in 1644.</p>

<p>Van Helmont was a scholarly, studious man,
and a philosopher. A theosophist and prone to
mysticism, he had many of the mental characteristics
of Paracelsus, without his fanaticism and
overweening egotism. He narrowed the number
of Aristotle’s elements down to one, and, like
Thales, considered water to be the true principle
of all things, supporting his theory by ingenious
observations on the growth of plants (see p. <a href="#Page_20">20</a>).
He first employed the term <i>gas</i>, and was aware
of the existence of various æriform substances,
anticipating Hales, who has been styled the
father of pneumatic chemistry, in the discovery
of many gaseous phenomena. He gave an accurate
description of carbonic acid gas, which he
termed <i>gas sylvestre</i>, and showed that it is produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
from limestone and potashes in the fermentation
of wine and beer, and that it is formed
in the body and in the earth. The doctrines
of the iatro-chemists were further spread by
Sylvius in Holland, and by Willis in England.</p>

<p><b>Francis de le Boë Sylvius</b>, born at Hanau
in 1614, became Professor of Medicine in the
University of Leyden, where he exercised great
influence as a teacher until his death in 1672.
Medicine he treated simply as a branch of applied
chemistry, and the vital processes of the
animal body as purely chemical. He freed the
theory of physic from much of the mystical
absurdity introduced into it by Paracelsus and
van Helmont, and by his practice brought chemical
remedies once more into vogue. He was
aware of the distinction between venous and
arterial blood, and that the red colour of the
latter was due to the influence of air. Combustion
and respiration he regarded as analogous
phenomena.</p>

<p><b>Thomas Willis</b> was born in Wiltshire in 1621,
and while a student at Christchurch bore arms in
the Royalist army when Oxford was garrisoned
for Charles I. In 1660 he became Sedleian
Professor of Natural Philosophy, and ultimately
settled in London as a physician. He died in
1675, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p>Willis imagined that all vital actions were
due to different kinds of fermentation, and that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
diseases were caused by abnormalities in the
fermentative process. Although a Paracelsian
as regards his theory of the constitution of matter,
he followed Sylvius and his pupil Tachenius
in banishing mysticism from medicine. He
was a skilful anatomist, and gave the first accurate
description of the brain and nerves.</p>

<p>Other notable iatro-chemists were Angelus
Sala, Daniel Sennert, Turquet de Mayerne (who
became body physician to James I.), Oswald
Croll, Adrian van Mynsicht, and Thomas Lieber.
Croll introduced the use of potassium sulphate
and succinic acid into medicine, and Van Mynsicht
that of tartar emetic. Various antimonial
preparations had previously been employed by
chemical physicians since the time of Basil Valentine,
despite the ban of the Parliament of
Paris on their use.</p>

<p>The chief service of iatro-chemistry to science
consisted in its influence in bringing chemistry
within the range of professional study, whereby
a great extension in its pursuit was effected,
with the result that a largely increased number
of substances was discovered. Moreover, this
wider experience of chemical processes familiarised
workers with chemical phenomena in
general, and thereby contributed to lay the foundations
of a general theory of chemical action,
which a succeeding age strove to complete.</p>

<p>During the period of iatro-chemistry, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
may be said to have extended from the first quarter
of the sixteenth century to the latter half
of the seventeenth, chemistry was advanced
along practical lines by the labours of many
men, chief of whom were Agricola the metallurgist,
Palissy the potter, and Glauber the technologist.
These men were primarily experimental
chemists, who took little or no part in the fruitless
polemics of the period, but followed their
avocation in the true spirit of investigators, and
thereby enriched science with many new and
well-ascertained facts.</p>

<p><b>George Agricola</b>, born at Glauchau in Saxony
in 1494, was a contemporary of Paracelsus.
After studying medicine at Leipzig, he devoted
himself to metallurgy and mineralogy, first at
Joachimsthal, and published a number of works
which were long deservedly regarded as the
leading treatises on these subjects.</p>

<p>In his <i>Libri</i> XII. <i>de re Metallica</i> he gives an
account of what was known in his time respecting
the extraction, preparation, and testing of
ores. He describes the smelting of copper and
the recovery of the silver which might be associated
with it. He also describes methods
of obtaining quicksilver, and of purifying it by
treatment with salt and vinegar. He gives a
full description of the method of obtaining gold
by amalgamation, and of recovering the mercury
by distillation. He gives accounts of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
smelting of lead, tin, iron, bismuth, and antimony,
and describes the manufacture of salt,
nitre, alum, and green vitriol.</p>

<p>The whole work, which is of folio size, is
illustrated by wood-cuts, which give a faithful
idea of the nature of the several operations, and
of the character of furnaces, trompes, bellows,
and tools employed in them. It is by far the
most important technical work of the sixteenth
century, and it exercised great influence on the
art of metallurgy. The descriptions—at least
as regards European processes—are evidently
the result of personal observation. Agricola
visited the mines, and faithfully noted the different
methods of sorting and washing the ores,
the characters of which he accurately describes.
His accounts of the various smelting operations
are so detailed that it is obvious they must have
been put together after personal inquiry. The
study of metallurgy, indeed, was the main object
of his life; and he devoted to its pursuit even the
pension which had been settled on him by
Maurice, Elector of Saxony. He became Mayor
of Chemnitz, died there in 1555, and was buried
at Zeitz.</p>

<p><b>Bernard Palissy</b> lived throughout the greater
portion of the sixteenth century. Although
not a professed chemist, nor a follower of any
particular school, he was an ardent self-taught
experimentalist and a keen and accurate observer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
who greatly enriched ceramic art by his
discoveries.</p>

<p><b>Johann Rudolf Glauber</b> was born at Karlstadt,
in Bavaria, in 1604, and after a restless life died
in Amsterdam in his sixty-fourth year. He
published an encyclopædia of chemical processes,
in which he describes the preparation of a great
variety of substances of technical importance.
The greater number of the pharmacopœias of
the seventeenth century are indebted to him for
their descriptions of the mode of manufacture
of their official preparations. He discovered
sodium sulphate—his <i>sal mirabile</i>, still frequently
named after him—and introduced it
into medicine.</p>

<p>During this period the common mineral acids—sulphuric,
hydrochloric, and nitric—became
ordinary articles of commerce, and were used
in the manufacture of a number of useful products,
chiefly inorganic salts. A considerable
number of metallic oxides were also in common
use, and were applied to a variety of purposes in
the arts. The knowledge of definite organic
substances was much more limited. Acetic acid
had long been known, but was first obtained in a
concentrated form during this period by the distillation
of verdigris. A number of other acetates
were also known, as well as certain tartrates—as,
for example, salt of sorrel, Rochelle or seignette
salt, and tartar emetic. Succinic and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
benzoic acid were introduced into medicine, and
Tachenius discovered one of the characteristic
acids of fat and oil (stearic acid). Spirit of
wine was, of course, largely made and used
in the preparation of tinctures and essences.
Ether, originally known as <i>oleum vitrioli dulce
verum</i>, was first discovered by Valerius Cordus;
and a mixture of it with alcohol, long known as
Hoffmann’s drops, appears to have been employed
as a medicine by Paracelsus.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">“The Sceptical Chemist”: The Dawn of
Scientific Chemistry.</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> latter half of the seventeenth century
was a remarkable period in the history of
the intellectual development of Europe. At that
time nearly every department of human knowledge
seemed to have become permeated by an
eager spirit of scepticism, inquiry, and reform.
The foundation of the Royal Society of London
for Improving Natural Knowledge, the Accademia
del Cimento of Florence, the Academie
Royale at Paris, the Berlin Academy, all within
a few years of each other, was significant of the
times. Chemistry was no longer to be a sacred
mystery, to be known only to priests, and its
secrets jealously guarded by them. Science had
chafed under the domination of the schoolmen;
it was now contemptuous of the dialectics of
the Spagyrists. Experimentarian philosophy
became even fashionable; and the purely deductive
methods of the Peripatetics gradually gave
place to the only sound method of advancing
natural knowledge. The supremacy of the old
philosophy may be said to have been first
distinctly challenged by Robert Boyle. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
appearance in 1661 of his book, <i>The Sceptical
Chemist</i>, marks a turning-point in the history
of chemistry. The “Chemico-physical Doubts
and Paradoxes” raised by Boyle “touching the
experiments whereby vulgar Spagyrists are
wont to endeavour to evince their Salt, Sulphur,
and Mercury to be the true Principles of Things,”
eventually sealed the fate of the doctrine of the
<i>tria prima</i>, and of the tenets of the school of
Paracelsus.</p>

<p>In this treatise Boyle sets out to prove that
the number of the peripatetic elements or
principles hitherto assumed by chemists is, to
say the least, doubtful. The words “element”
and “principle” are used by him as equivalent
terms, and signify those primitive and simple
bodies of which compounds may be said to be
composed, and into which these compounds are
ultimately resolvable. He considered that the
matter of all bodies was originally divided into
small particles of different shapes and sizes, and
that these particles might unite into small
“parcels,” not easily separable again; that a
great variety of compounds may arise from a few
ingredients; that various substances are obtainable
from bodies by fire; that fire is not the
true and genuine analyser of bodies, since it does
not separate the principles of a body, but
variously alters its nature; and that some things
obtained from a body by fire were not its proper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
or essential ingredients. Three is not precisely
and universally the number of the distinct substances
or elements into which all compound
bodies are resolvable by fire, inasmuch as some
bodies afford more than three principles. Earth
and water are as much chemical principles as
salt, sulphur, and mercury. Even the limitation
to five chemical principles is too narrow. Such
is proved to be the case by the mode in which
bodies, animals and vegetable, grow, and by the
analysis of minerals and metals. The chemical
theory of “qualities” of the Spagyrists is narrow,
defective, and uncertain; supposes things not
proved; is often superfluous, and frequently
contradicts the phenomena of nature. The
“principles” found in bodies cannot be the
cause of their qualities, since contrary qualities
are ascribed to the same body. He concludes,
therefore, that the Paracelsian elements—their
“salt,” “sulphur,” and “mercury”—are
not the first and most simple principles
of bodies; but that these consist, at most,
of concretions of corpuscles or particles more
simple than they, and possessing the radical
and universal properties of volume, shape, and
motion.</p>

  <span class="subhead">From a painting by F. Kerseboom in the possession of the Royal Society.</span></p></div></div>

<p><b>Robert Boyle</b>, fourteenth child and the
seventh and youngest son of Richard the
“Great” Earl of Cork, and Lord High Chancellor
of Ireland, was born at Lismore in 1626. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
was educated at Eton under Sir Henry Wotton,
and, after spending some years on the Continent,
settled at Stalbridge in Dorset, where he owned
a manor. He became a member of what was
known as the Invisible College, a small association
of men interested in the new philosophy,
who met at each other’s houses in London, and
occasionally at Gresham College, “to discourse
and consider of philosophical inquiries and such
as related thereunto.” The meetings were
subsequently held in Oxford, and Boyle took up
his residence there in 1654. Here—in association
with Wilkins; John Wallis and Seth Ward,
the two Savilian Professors of Geometry and
Astronomy; Thomas Willis, the physician, then
student of Christ Church; Christopher Wren,
then Fellow of All Souls’ College; Goddard,
Warden of Merton; and Ralph Bathurst, Fellow
of Trinity, and afterwards its President—they
sought to cultivate the new philosophy, “being
satisfied that there was no certain way of
arriving at any competent knowledge unless
they made a variety of experiments upon natural
bodies. In order to discover what phenomena
they would produce, they pursued that method
by themselves with great industry, and then
communicated their discoveries to each other.”
The Invisible College eventually grew into the
Royal Society, which received its charter in 1663.
Boyle removed to London in 1668, and died<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
there on December 31st, 1691, in the sixty-fifth
year of his age.</p>

<p>A man of integrity, modest, simple, and unassuming,
Boyle was an assiduous and true student
of science, and practically the whole of his
life was given to its pursuit. His social position,
his example, the purity of his private life, and
the fame of his discoveries made his personal
influence very considerable, to the great advantage
of science in this country. His experimental
work was of a high order. He
introduced the air-pump into England, and his
“pneumatical engine” enabled him to discover
many of the fundamental properties of a gas,
notably the relation of its volume to pressure.
He also discovered the dependence of the boiling
point of a liquid upon atmospheric pressure,
explained the action of the syphon, the effect of
the air on the vibration of a pendulum and on
the propagation of sound, and made experiments
on the nature of flame, and on the relation of
air to combustion and respiration. In his <i>History
of Fluidity</i> he seeks to show that a body
seems to be fluid by consisting of corpuscles
touching one another only in some parts of their
surfaces; whence, by reason of the numerous
spaces between them, they easily glide along
each other till they meet with some resisting
body to whose internal surface they exquisitely accommodate
themselves. He considers the requisites<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
of fluidity to be chiefly these: The smallness
of the component particles, their determinate
figure, the vacant spaces between them, and
the fact of their being agitated variously and
apart by their own innate motion or by some
thinner substance which tosses them about in
its passage through them. His published works
contain many well-authenticated chemical facts,
which are commonly held to be the discovery of
a later time. He prepared acetone by the distillation
of the acetates of lead and lime; and he
isolated methyl alcohol from the products of the
destructive distillation of wood. He was one of
the earliest to insist on the necessity of studying
the forms of crystals. He saw in their formation
proof that the internal motions, configuration,
and position of the integral parts are all that is
necessary to account for alterations and diversities
in outward character. Some of the stock
illustrations of our lecture-rooms were of his
contrivance. Thus he illustrated the expansive
power of freezing water by bursting a plugged
gun-barrel filled with water by solidifying the
water by means of a mixture of snow and salt—a
freezing mixture which he first introduced.</p>

<p>Boyle was the first to formulate our present
conception of an element in contradistinction
to that of the Greeks and the schoolmen who
influenced the theories of the iatro-chemists.
In the sense understood by him, the Aristotelian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
elements were not true elements, nor were the
salt, sulphur, and mercury of the school of
Paracelsus. He was also the first to define the
relation of an element to a compound, and to
draw the distinction we still make between compounds
and mixtures. He revived the atomic
hypothesis, and explained chemical combination
on the basis of affinity. He contended that one
of the main objects of the chemist was to ascertain
the nature of compounds; and thereby he
stimulated the application of analysis to chemistry.
Boyle discovered a number of qualitative
reactions, and applied them to the detection of
substances, either free or in combination.</p>

<p>But Boyle’s greatest service to learning consisted
in the new spirit he introduced into chemistry.
Henceforward chemistry was no longer
the mere helpmeet of medicine. She became
an independent science, the principles of which
were to be ascertained by experiment; a science
to be studied with the object of discovering the
laws regulating the phenomena with which it
is concerned—and hence elucidating truth for
truth’s sake. The old philosophy of the Greeks
had, as we have seen, become merged into the
doctrine of the iatro-chemists; and this was now
to be purified from the theosophical mysticism
with which Paracelsus and his followers had enshrouded
it. “The dialectical subtleties of the
schoolmen much more,” says Boyle, “declare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
the wit of him that uses them than increase the
knowledge or remove the doubts of sober lovers
of truth.... For in such speculative inquiries
where the naked knowledge of the truth
is the thing principally aimed at, what does he
teach me worth thanks, that does not, if he can,
make his notion intelligible to me, but by mystical
terms and ambiguous phrases darkens what
he should clear up, and makes me add the trouble
of guessing at the sense of what he equivocally
expresses, to that of learning the truth of what
he seems to deliver.” The influence of the new
spirit thus infused into the science by Boyle is
seen in the general style of chemical literature
at the end of the seventeenth century, when compared
with that of the close of the sixteenth. The
mysticism and obscurity of the alchemists were
no longer tolerated.</p>

<p>Boyle was slender and tall, with a countenance
pale and emaciated. His constitution was delicate
and his body feeble, and it was only by
strict attention to diet and regularity of exercise
that he accomplished what he did. Although he
suffered occasionally from an excessive lowness
of spirits, there was nothing morose or ascetic in
his nature. He was never married, although,
says his friend John Evelyn, “few men were
more facetious and agreeable in conversation
with the ladies whenever he happened to be
engaged among them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
Kindly, courteous, charitable; unaffected, and
temperate in his manner of life, Boyle enjoyed
the respect and esteem of all his contemporaries.
It was said of him that he was never known to
have offended any person in his whole life by any
part of his deportment. He allowed himself
a great deal of decent cheerfulness, and had
about him all the tenderness of good nature, as
well as all the softness of friendship. These
gave him a large share of other men’s concerns,
for he had a quick sense of the miseries of mankind.
Although a philosopher in the broadest
sense of that term, his peculiar and favourite
study was chemistry, “in which,” says Bishop
Burnet, “he engaged with none of those ravenous
and ambitious designs that drew many into
them. His design was only to find out nature,
to see into what principles things might be resolved,
and of what they were compounded.”</p>

<p><b>John Kunkel</b>, born in 1630, was the son of an
alchemist attached to the Court of the Duke of
Holstein. After serving his father for some
years, he obtained employment as chemist and
pharmacist under the Dukes Charles and Henry,
of Lauenburg. He subsequently entered the
laboratory at Dresden of John George II., Elector
of Saxony, and, after teaching chemistry at the
University of Wittenburg, then famous as a
medical school, he accepted an invitation to take
charge of the glass works and laboratory of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Elector of Brandenburg, at Berlin. The laboratory
was burnt down, and then Charles XI. of
Sweden called him to Stockholm and ennobled
him as Baron von Lowenstiern. He died in
Stockholm in 1702. Kunkel’s chief work is his
<i>Laboratorium Chymicum</i>, published after his
death. It was written in German. In it Kunkel
relates how he acquired possession of a knowledge
of the manufacture of Baldwin’s phosphorus,
and of the phosphorus discovered by
Brand—perhaps the most important, as it
certainly was one of the most striking, of the
chemical discoveries of the seventeenth century.
Kunkel did much to liberate chemical literature
from the mysticism and obscurity of alchemy.
He was scornful of the theories of
the adepts, and contemptuous of their <i>tria
prima</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>I, old man that I am, who have been occupied
with chemistry for sixty years, have never yet
been able to discover their fixed sulphur, or
how it enters into the composition of metals....
Moreover, they are not agreed among themselves
respecting the kind of sulphur. The
sulphur of one is not the sulphur of the other.
To that one may reply that each is at liberty
to baptise his child as he likes. I agree: you
may even, if you are so disposed, call an ass a
cow; but you will never make anyone believe
that your cow is an ass.</p></blockquote>

<p class="in0"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
As to the alkahest he <span class="locked">says:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>There has been much discussion concerning
this grand natural solvent. Some derive it
from the Latin—<i>akali est</i>; others from the
two German words <i>all geist</i> (all gas); lastly,
others say it is from <i>alles est</i> (that’s all). As
to myself, I do not believe in Van Helmont’s
universal solvent. I call it by its true name—<i>alles
Lügen heist</i>, or <i>alles Lügen ist</i> (it is all a lie).</p></blockquote>

<p>Kunkel discovered the secret of the manufacture
of aventurine glass and of ruby glass by
means of the purple of Cassius—a product from
gold first obtained by a doctor of medicine of that
name in Hamburg. He made observations on
fermentation and putrefaction—recognised that
alum was a double salt (<i>salduplicatum</i>); described
the present method of repairing pure silver, and
of parting gold and silver by means of sulphuric
acid. He also described the mode of preparing
a number of essential oils, detected the presence
of stearopten in oils, and discovered nitrous ether.</p>

<p><b>John Joachim Becher</b>, the son of a Lutheran
minister, was born at Speyer in 1635. Owing to
the death of his father and the devastation of
the family property during the Thirty Years’
War, Becher had a hard struggle with poverty
during his youth, and led a restless, wandering
life. In 1666 he was Professor of Medicine in the
University of Mayence. Subsequently he went
to Munich as head of the finest laboratory in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
Europe, but, quarrelling with the Chancellor of
the Bavarian Court, betook himself to Vienna.
After a short stay there, he quitted Austria for
Holland, and established himself in Haarlem.
Here he proposed to the States-General to extract
gold from the sand-dunes; but, the project failing,
he left for England and visited the Cornish mines.
On the invitation of the Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow,
he returned to Germany. Shortly
afterwards (in 1682) he died, in the forty-seventh
year of his age. Becher’s name is remembered
mainly in connection with his theory of combustion,
which, as we shall see, was subsequently
developed by Stahl into the theory of Phlogiston—a
generalisation which dominated chemistry
until near the close of the eighteenth century.</p>

<p><b>John Mayow</b>, born in Cornwall in 1645, was
a practising physician, whose name chiefly lives
by virtue of his clear recognition of the substance
or principle in the air which is concerned
in combustion, the calcination of metals, respiration,
and the conversion of venous into arterial
blood. This substance, which he found to be
contained in saltpetre, he called <i>spiritus igno-aëreus</i>
or <i>nitro aëreust</i>. Mayow died at the age
of thirty-four. Had he been able to follow up
his observations, he might have influenced very
materially the development of theoretical chemistry.
As it was, he was practically overlooked
by his contemporaries, and the real significance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
of his work was not appreciated until long afterwards.</p>

<p><b>Nicolas Lemery</b>, also born in 1645, wrote a
<i>Cours de Chimie</i>, one of the best text-books of
the time, which passed through as many as
thirteen editions, and was translated into English,
German, Latin, Italian, and Spanish.</p>

<p>In this book he strove, as he says, to express
himself clearly, and to avoid the obscurities
which were to be found in the authors who
had preceded him.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The fine imaginations of other philosophers
concerning their physical principles may elevate
the spirit by their grand ideas, but they prove
nothing demonstratively. And, as chemistry
is a science of observation, it can only be based
on what is palpable and demonstrative.</p></blockquote>

<p>Nicolas Lemery, who is not to be confounded
with his son Louis, also a chemist, made a considerable
number of contributions to pharmaceutical
chemistry; and his <i>Pharmacopée Universelle</i>,
<i>Dictionnaire Universel des Drogues Simples</i>, and
<i>Traité de l’Antimoine</i> were standard works in
their day.</p>

<p>Lemery was at one time a Protestant, and
on the revocation of the Edict of Nantes fled
to England; but, embracing Catholicism, he returned
to Paris, re-established his pharmacy, and
was elected into the Academy in 1699. He died
in 1715.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
<b>William Homberg</b>, born in Batavia in 1652,
was originally intended for the profession of law,
but, becoming attached to science, studied botany
and medicine in Padua, chemistry at Bologna
and in London, mechanics and optics at
Rome, and anatomy at Leyden. In the course
of his travels he visited the mines of Germany,
Hungary, Bohemia, and Sweden. In 1682 he
was invited to Paris by Colbert, and in 1691 was
made a member of the Academy and was placed
by the Duke of Orleans in charge of his laboratory—then
one of the finest in Europe. Homberg
married the daughter of Dodart, the physician.
She became an expert <i>préparateur</i>, and was
of great assistance to him in his experimental
inquiries. He first made known the existence
of phosphorus in France, discovered by Brand,
of Hamburg, and he described the phosphorescent
salt associated with his name. He made
important observations on the saturation of
alkalis by acids, and was aware that they combined
in different proportions. He was an industrious
worker, and, with the exception of
Cassini, was the most active member of the
Academy. He died on September 24th, 1715.</p>

<p>Next to Boyle, perhaps the most active agent
in emancipating chemistry from the yoke of
alchemy was Boerhaave, who, by his teaching
as Professor of Physic, raised the University of
Leyden to the summit of its fame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
<b>Hermann Boerhaave</b>, the son of a minister,
was born near Leyden, in 1668. He occupied himself
in turn with theology, classics, mathematics,
chemistry, and botany, when he turned to physic,
and, after a course of study at the University
of Harderwyk, in Gelderland, began to practise.
In 1702 he was appointed to a lectureship, and
eventually to the Chair of Medicine, in the University
of Leyden, of which he became Rector
in 1714. His reputation as a teacher spread
throughout Europe, and steadily increased until
his death.</p>

<p>Boerhaave was one of the most learned men
of his age, and singularly well cultured, not only
in science but in history, poetry, and polite literature.
He conversed in English, French, and
German, and read Italian and Spanish with facility.
“The Latin he spoke extempore in lectures
or conversation was so clear that, with his
action, method, and the aptness of his similes,
he could level the most abstruse points to the
meanest capacities.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> He was fond of music, and
a good performer on several instruments, particularly
the lute. He delighted to welcome
musicians to his house. His profession as a physician
brought him wealth, much of which he
spent in horticulture; and the garden of his
country seat, nearly eight acres in extent,
was enriched with all the exotic trees he could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
procure and induce to flourish in the climate of
Holland.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Burton, <i>Life of Boerhaave</i>, p. 58 <i>et seq.</i></p></div>

<p>Boerhaave was of a robust frame and healthy
constitution, early inured to constant exercise
and the inclemencies of weather. His stature
was rather tall, and his habit corpulent. He had a
large head, short neck, florid complexion, light
brown curled hair (for he did not wear a wig), an
open countenance, and resembled Socrates in
the flatness of his nose and his natural urbanity.
He died at Leyden on September 23rd, 1738, in
the seventieth year of his age.</p>

<p>As a chemist Boerhaave is chiefly known by
his <i>Elementa Chemia</i>, published in 1732—the
most complete and most luminous chemical
treatise of its time, translations of which appeared
in the chief European languages. The work is
divided into three main parts. The first is
concerned with the origin and progress of the art,
and with the personal history of its most distinguished
cultivators. The second and largest
part deals with the attempt to form a system of
chemistry based on such observational matter
as seemed well established. The third consists
of a collection of chemical processes relating to
the analysis or decomposition of bodies, grouped
under the heads of “vegetables,” “animals,”
and “fossils”—the beginnings, in fact, of subdivision
of the science into organic and inorganic
chemistry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
As regards his belief in alchemy, Boerhaave
was an agnostic: he neither affirmed nor denied
the possibility of transmutation. In this respect
he resembled Newton and Boyle. Boyle,
indeed, was singularly cautious and reticent in
his references to alchemistic matters. As was
said of him by Shaw, he was too wise to set any
bounds to nature: he was not prone to say that
every strange thing must needs be impossible,
for he saw strange things every day, and was
well aware that there are powerful forces in the
world of whose laws and modes of action he
knew nothing. With that wariness which was
habitual to him, he was wont to say that “those
who had seen them might better believe them
than those who had not”; and he was modest
enough to suppose that Paracelsus or Helmont
might conceivably know of agents of which he
was ignorant.</p>

<p>Boerhaave unquestionably spent much time
in the study of alchemical works, particularly
those of Paracelsus and Helmont, which he repeatedly
read. The <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>
of the Royal Society contain the results of a
laborious but fruitless investigation by him on
quicksilver, which he undertook in the hope of
discovering the seminal or engendering matter
which, on the old theory of the generation of
metals, was supposed to be contained in mercury.
But although, as he relates, he tortured it by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
“conquassation, trituration, digestion, and by
distillation, either alone or amalgamated with
lead, tin, or gold, repeating this operation to
511 or even to 877 distillations,” the mercury
appeared only “rather more bright and liquid,
without any other variation in its form or virtues,
and acquired very little, if any, increase of its
specific gravity.”</p>

<p><b>Stephen Hales</b> (1677–1761), an ingenious divine—he
held the perpetual curacy of Teddington,
and lived practically the greater part of his
life there—distinguished as a physiologist and
inventor, occupied himself in chemical pursuits,
and made a number of observations on the production
of gaseous substances. His results were
communicated to the Royal Society and subsequently
republished, in a collected form, under
the title of <i>Statical Essays</i>. In these experiments
he used methods very similar in principle to those
subsequently employed by Priestley. It is evident
from his description of his experiments that
he must have prepared a considerable number of
gaseous substances—hydrogen, carbonic acid,
carbonic oxide, sulphur dioxide, marsh gas, etc.—but
he seems to have made no systematic
attempt to study their properties, as he considered
that they were simply air, modified or
“tinctured” by the presence of substances which
he regarded as more or less fortuitous. Prior
to the time of Black all forms of gaseous substance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
were regarded as substantially identical—in
fact, as being <i>air</i>, as understood by the
Ancients—a simple elementary substance. It
was Black’s study of carbonic acid which first
clearly established that there were essentially
distinct varieties of gaseous matter.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Even</span> before the appearance of <i>The Sceptical
Chemist</i> there was a growing conviction that
the old hypotheses as to the essential nature of
matter were inadequate and misleading. We
have seen how the four “elements” of the Peripatetics
had become merged into the <i>tria prima</i>—the
“salt,” “sulphur,” and “mercury”—of the
Paracelsians. As the phenomena of chemical
action became better known, the latter iatro-chemists—or,
rather, that section of them which
recognised that chemistry had wider aims than
to minister merely to medicine—felt that the
conception of the <i>tria prima</i>, as understood by
Paracelsus and his followers, was incapable of
being generalised into a theory of chemistry.
Becher, while clinging to the conception of three
primordial substances as making up all forms of
matter, changed the qualities hitherto associated
with them. According to the new theory, all
matter was composed of a mercurial, a vitreous,
and a combustible substance or principle, in
varying proportions, depending upon the nature
of the particular form of matter. When a body
was burnt or a metal calcined, the combustible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
substance—the <i>terra pinguis</i> of Becher—escaped.</p>

<p>This attempt to connect the phenomena of
combustion and calcination with the general
phenomena of chemistry was still further developed
by Stahl, and was eventually extended
into a comprehensive theory of chemistry, which
was fairly satisfactory so long as no effort was
made to test its sufficiency by an appeal to the
balance.</p>

<p><b>George Ernest Stahl</b>, who developed Becher’s
notion into the theory of <i>phlogiston</i> (φλογιοτός—burnt),
and thereby created a generalisation
which first made chemistry a science, was born at
Anspach in 1660, became Professor of Medicine
and Chemistry at Halle in 1693, physician to
the King of Prussia in 1716, and died in Berlin
in 1734.</p>

<p>Stahl contributed little or nothing to practical
chemistry; and no new fact or discovery is associated
with his name. His service to science consists
in the temporary success he achieved in
grouping chemical phenomena, and in explaining
them consistently by a comprehensive hypothesis.</p>

<p>The theory of phlogiston was originally
broached as a theory of combustion. According
to this theory, bodies such as coal, charcoal,
wood, oil, fat, etc., burn because they contain a
combustible principle, which was assumed to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
a material substance and uniform in character.
This substance was known as phlogiston. All
combustible bodies were to be regarded, therefore,
as compounds, one of their constituents being
phlogiston: their different natures depended
partly upon the proportion of phlogiston they
contain, and partly upon the nature and amount
of their other constituents. A body, when
burning, was parting with its phlogiston; and
all the phenomena of combustion—the flame,
heat, and light—were caused by the violence
of the expulsion of that substance. Certain
metals—as, for example, zinc—could be
caused to burn, and thereby to yield earthy
substances, sometimes white in colour, at other
times variously coloured. These earthy substances
were called <i>calces</i>, from their general
resemblance to lime. Other metals, like lead
and mercury, did not appear to burn; but on
heating them they gradually lost their metallic
appearance, and became converted into calces.
This operation was known as calcination. In
the act of burning or of calcination phlogiston
was expelled. Hence metals were essentially
compound: they consisted of phlogiston and a
calx, the nature of which determined the character
of the metal. By adding phlogiston to a
calx the metal was regenerated. Thus, on
heating the calx of zinc or of lead with coal, or
charcoal, or wood, metallic zinc or lead was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
again formed. When a candle burns, its phlogiston
is transferred to the air; if burned in a
limited supply of air, combustion ceases, because
the air becomes saturated with phlogiston.</p>

<p>Respiration is a kind of combustion whereby
the temperature of the body is maintained. It
consists simply in the transference of the phlogiston
of the body to the air. If we attempt
to breathe in a confined space, the air becomes
eventually saturated with the phlogiston, and
respiration stops. The various manifestations
of chemical action, in like manner, were attributed
to this passing to and fro of phlogiston.
The colour of a substance is connected with the
amount of phlogiston it contains. Thus, when
lead is heated, it yields a yellow substance (litharge);
when still further heated, it yields a red
substance (red lead). These differences in
colour were supposed to depend upon the varying
amount of phlogiston expelled.</p>

<p>The doctrine of phlogiston was embraced by
nearly all Stahl’s German contemporaries, notably
by Marggraf, Neumann, Eller, and Pott.
It spread into Sweden, and was accepted by
Bergman and Scheele; into France, where it
was taught by Duhamel, Rouelle, and Macquer;
and into Great Britain, where its most influential
supporters were Priestley and Cavendish. It
continued to be the orthodox faith until the last
quarter of the eighteenth century, when, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
the discovery of oxygen, it was overturned by
Lavoisier.</p>

<p>During the sway of phlogiston chemistry made
many notable advances—not by its aid, but
rather in spite of it. As a matter of fact, until
the time of Lavoisier few, if any, investigations
were made with the express intention of testing
it, or of establishing its sufficiency. When new
phenomena were observed the attempt was no
doubt made to explain them by its aid, frequently
with no satisfactory result. Indeed,
even in the time of Stahl, facts were known
which it was difficult or impossible to reconcile
with his doctrine; but these were either ignored,
or their true import explained away. Although,
therefore, these advances were in no way connected
with phlogiston, it will be convenient to
deal with the more important of them now,
inasmuch as they were made during the phlogistic
period.</p>

<p>With the exception of Marggraf, Stahl’s
German contemporaries contributed few facts of
first-rate importance to chemistry. <b>Pott</b>, who
was born at Halberstadt in 1692 and become
Professor of Chemistry in Berlin in 1737, is
chiefly remembered by his work on porcelain,
the chemical nature and mode of origin of which
he first elucidated. <b>Marggraf</b>, born in Berlin
in 1709, was one of the best analysts of his age.
He first clearly distinguished between lime and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
alumina, and was one of the earliest to point out
that the vegetable alkali (potash) differed from
the mineral alkali (soda). He also showed that
gypsum, heavy spar, and potassium sulphate
were analogous in composition. He clearly
indicated the relation of phosphoric acid to
phosphorus, described a number of methods of
preparing that acid, and explained the origin of
the phosphoric acid in urine.</p>

<p>Of the Swedish chemists of that period, the
most notable was Scheele.</p>

<p><b>Carl Wilhelm Scheele</b> was born in 1742 at
Stralsund. When fourteen years of age he was
apprenticed to an apothecary at Gothenburg,
and began the study of experimental chemistry,
which he continued to prosecute as an apothecary
at Malmö, Stockholm, Upsala, and eventually
at Köping on Lake Malar, where he died in
1786, in the forty-third year of his age. During
the comparatively short period of his scientific
activity Scheele made himself the greatest
chemical discoverer of his time.</p>

<p>He first isolated chlorine, and determined the
individuality of manganese and baryta. He
was an independent discoverer of oxygen,
ammonia, and hydrogen chloride. He discovered
also hydrofluoric, nitro-sulphonic, molybdic,
tungstic, and arsenic, among the inorganic acids;
and lactic, gallic, pyrogallic, oxalic, citric, tartaric,
malic, mucic, and uric acids among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
organic acids. He isolated glycerine and milk-sugar;
determined the nature of microcosmic
salt, borax, and Prussian blue, and prepared
hydrocyanic acid. He demonstrated that
graphite is a form of carbon. He discovered
the chemical nature of sulphuretted hydrogen,
arsenuretted hydrogen, and the green arsenical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
pigment known by his name. He invented new
processes for preparing ether, powder of algaroth,
phosphorus, calomel, and <i>magnesia alba</i>. He
first prepared ferrous ammonium sulphate,
showed how iron may be analytically separated
from manganese; and described the method of
breaking up mineral silicates by fusion with
alkaline carbonates. Scheele’s contributions to
chemical theory were slight and unimportant,
but as a discoverer he stands pre-eminent.</p>

<p>Of the French phlogistians we have space only
to mention Duhamel and Macquer.</p>

<p><b>Henry Louis Duhamel du Monceau</b> was born
at Paris in 1700. He was one of the earliest
to make experiments on ossification, and one of
the first to detect the difference between potash
and soda.</p>

<p><b>Peter Joseph Macquer</b> was born in 1718 at
Paris. He investigated the nature of Prussian
blue (discovered by Diesbach, of Berlin, in 1710),
worked on platinum, wrote one of the best text-books
of his time, published a dictionary of
chemistry, and was an authority of the chemistry
of dyeing.</p>

<p>In addition to those already mentioned, the
most notable names as workers in chemistry in
Great Britain during the eighteenth century are
Black, Priestley, and Cavendish.</p>

<p><b>Joseph Black</b> was born in 1728 at Bordeaux,
where his father was engaged in the wine trade.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
A student of the University of Glasgow, he
became its Professor of Chemistry in 1756. In
1766 he was transferred to the Chemical Chair
of the University of Edinburgh, and died in 1799.
Black published only three papers, the most
important of which is entitled <i>Experiments upon
Magnesia Alba, Quicklime, and Other Alkaline
Substances</i>. He proved that magnesia is a
peculiar earth differing in properties from lime.
Lime is a pure earth, while limestone is carbonate
of lime. He showed that magnesia will also
combine with carbonic acid, and he explained
that the difference between the mild and caustic
alkalis is that the former contain carbonic acid,
whereas the latter do not. He also explained
how lime is able to convert the mild alkalis into
caustic alkalis. Simple and well known as these
facts are to-day, their discovery in 1755 excited
great interest, and marked an epoch in the
history of chemistry. Black’s name is associated
with the discovery of latent and specific
heat, and he made the first determinations of the
amount of heat required to convert ice into
water.</p>

  <span class="subhead">From a mezzotint after Fuseli in the possession of the Royal Society.</span></p></div></div>

<p><b>Joseph Priestley</b>, the son of a clothdresser,
was born in 1733 at Fieldhead, near Leeds.
When seven years of age, on the death of his
mother, he was taken charge of by his aunt, and
was educated for the Nonconformist ministry,
eventually becoming a Unitarian. He was first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
attracted to science by the study of electricity,
of which he compiled a history. At Leeds,
where he had charge of the Mill Hill congregation,
he turned his attention to chemistry,
mainly from the circumstance that he lived near
a brewery and had the opportunity of procuring
large quantities of carbonic acid, the properties
of which he carefully studied. He abandoned
the ministry for a time to become librarian and
literary companion to Lord Shelburne, with
whom he remained seven years. During this
time he industriously pursued chemical inquiry,
and discovered a large number of æriform
bodies—viz., nitric oxide, hydrogen chloride,
sulphur dioxide, silicon fluoride, ammonia,
nitrous oxide, and, most important of all from
the point of view of chemical theory, oxygen gas.
Priestley’s work gave a remarkable impetus to
the study of pneumatic chemistry. It exercised
great influence on the extension of chemical
science, and—in other hands than his—on the
development of chemical theory. The most
important of his contributions to science are
contained in his <i>Experiments and Observations
on Different Kinds of Air</i>. This work not only
gives an account of the methods by which he
isolated the gases he discovered, but describes
a great number of incidental observations, such
as the action of vegetation on respired air,
showing that the green parts of plants are able<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
in sunlight to decompose carbonic acid and to
restore oxygen to the atmosphere. He was, in
fact, one of the earliest to trace the specific
action of animals and plants on atmospheric air,
and to show how these specific actions maintained
its purity and constancy of composition.
He initiated the art of eudiometry (gas analysis),
and was the first to establish that the air is not
a simple substance, as imagined by the ancients.
Priestley is to be credited with the invention of
<i>soda-water</i>, which he prepared as a remedy for
scurvy; and his name is connected with the
so-called <i>pneumatic trough</i>—a simple enough
piece of apparatus, but one which proved to be
of the greatest service to him in his inquiries.</p>

<p>After leaving Lord Shelburne, Priestley removed
to Birmingham and resumed his ministry.
His religious and political opinions made him
obnoxious to the Church and State party; and
during the riots of 1791 his house was wrecked,
his books and apparatus destroyed, and his
life endangered. Eventually he emigrated to
America, and settled at Northumberland, where
he died on February 6th, 1804, in the seventy-first
year of his age.</p>

<p><b>Henry Cavendish</b> was born at Nice in 1731,
and died in London in 1810. He was a natural
philosopher in the widest sense of that term,
and occupied himself in turn with nearly every
branch of physical science. He was a capable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
astronomer and an excellent mathematician,
and he was one of the earliest to work on the
subject of specific heat, and to improve the
thermometer and the methods of making thermometric
observations. He also determined the
mean density of the earth. He made accurate
observations on the properties of carbonic acid
and hydrogen, greatly improved the methods of
eudiometry, and first established the practical
uniformity of the composition of atmospheric air.
His greatest discovery, however, was his determination
of <i>the composition of water</i>. He was
the first to prove that water is not a simple or
elementary substance, as supposed by the
ancients, but is a compound of hydrogen and
oxygen. In certain of his trials he found that
the water formed by the union of oxygen and
hydrogen was acid to the taste; and the search
for the cause of this acidity led him to the discovery
of the <i>composition of nitric acid</i>. He
was the first to make a fairly accurate analysis
of a natural water, and to explain what is known
as the <i>hardness of water</i>.</p>

<p>Phlogistonism may be said to have dominated
chemistry during three-fourths of the eighteenth
century. Although radically false as a conception
and of little use in the true interpretation of
chemical phenomena, it cannot be said to have
actually retarded the pursuit of chemistry.
Men went on working and accumulating chemical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
facts uninspired and, for the most part, uninfluenced
by it. Even Priestley, perhaps one of
the most conservative of the followers of Stahl,
regarded his dogma with a complacent tolerance;
and as its inconsistencies became apparent
he was more than once on the point of renouncing
it. Of one thing he was quite convinced, and
that was that Stahl had greatly erred in his
conception of the real nature of phlogiston.
Perhaps the most signal disservice which
phlogiston did to chemistry was to delay the
general recognition of Boyle’s views of the nature
of the elements. The alchemists, it will be
remembered, regarded the metals as essentially
compound. Boyle was disposed to believe that
they were simple. Becher and Stahl and their
followers, until the last quarter of the eighteenth
century, also regarded them as compounds,
phlogiston being one of their constituents. On
the other hand, what we now know to be compounds—such
as the calces, the acids, and
water itself—were held by the phlogistians to
be simple substances.</p>

<p>The discovery, in 1774, of oxygen—the
dephlogisticated air of Priestley—and the
recognition of the part it plays in the phenomena
which phlogiston was invoked to explain, mark
the termination of one era in chemical history
and the beginning of another. Before entering
upon an account of the new era it is desirable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
to take stock of the actual condition of chemical
knowledge at the end of the phlogistic period,
and to show what advances had been made in
pure and applied chemistry during that time.</p>

<p>During the eighteenth century greater insight
was gained into the operations of the form of
energy with which chemistry is mainly concerned,
and views concerning chemical affinity
and its causes began to assume more definite
shape, chiefly owing to the labours of Boerhaave,
Bergman, Geoffroy, and Rouelle. It was clearly
recognised that the large group of substances
comprised under the term “salts” were compound,
and made up of two contrasted and, in a
sense, antagonistic constituents, classed generically
as acids and bases.</p>

<p>On the practical side chemistry made considerable
progress. Analysis—a term originally
applied by Boyle—greatly advanced. It was,
of course, mainly qualitative; but, thanks to
the labours of Boyle, Hoffmann, Marggraf,
Scheele, Bergman, Gahn, and Cronstedt, certain
reactions and reagents came to be systematically
applied to the recognition of chemical substances,
and the precision with which these
reagents were used led to the detection of
hitherto unknown elements. The beginnings
of a quantitative analysis were made even before
the time of Boyle, but its principles were
greatly developed by him, and were further<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
extended by Homberg, Marggraf, and Bergman.
Marggraf accurately determined the amount of
silver chloride formed by adding common salt
to a solution of a known weight of silver, and
Bergman first pointed out that estimations of
substances might be conveniently made by
weighing them in the form of suitably prepared
compounds, which, it was implicitly assumed,
were of uniform and constant composition.
The foundations of an accurate system of gaseous
analysis were made by Cavendish; and various
forms of physical apparatus were applied to the
service of chemistry.</p>

<p>To the elements which were known prior to
Boyle’s time, although not recognised as such,
there were added phosphorus (Brand, 1669),
nitrogen (Rutherford), chlorine (Scheele, 1774),
manganese (Gahn, 1774), cobalt (Brandt, 1742),
nickel (Cronstedt, 1750), and platinum (Watson,
1750). Baryta was discovered by Scheele, and
strontia by Crawford. Phosphoric acid was
discovered by Boyle, and its true nature determined
by Marggraf; Cavendish first made
known the composition of nitric acid. As
already stated, Scheele first isolated molybdic
and tungstic acids and determined the existence
of a number of the organic acids (p. 75). Other
discoveries—such as the true nature of limestone
and <i>magnesia alba</i> and their relations
respectively to lime and magnesia by Black, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
many gaseous substances by Priestley, and the
compound nature of water by Cavendish—have
already been referred to.</p>

<p>Technical chemistry also greatly developed
during the eighteenth century, thanks to the
efforts of Gahn, Marggraf, Duhamel, Reaumur,
Macquer, Kunkel, and Hellot; and many important
industrial processes—such as the manufacture
of sulphuric acid by Ward of Richmond,
and subsequently by Roebuck at Birmingham,
and the Leblanc process of conversion of common
salt into alkali—had their origin during
this period.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">Lavoisier and La Révolution Chimique</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">We</span> have seen how chemistry made a new departure
during the political upheaval which
occurred in this country about the middle of the
seventeenth century. It acquired a new impetus
and took a fresh course during the political
cataclysm which overwhelmed France and
alarmed Europe towards the close of the
eighteenth century. The instigator and leader
of this second revolution in chemistry was
Lavoisier, one of the most distinguished men
of his age, and himself a victim of the political
fury of his own people.</p>

<p><b>Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier</b> was born in
Paris in 1743. At the Jardin du Roi he came
under the influence of Rouelle, one of the best
teachers of his time, who eventually shaped his
career as a chemist. In 1765 he sent to the
Academy his first paper on gypsum, which is
noteworthy as giving for the first time the true
explanation of the “setting” of plaster of Paris,
and the reason why overburnt gypsum will not
rehydrate. Three years later he became a member
of the <i>Ferme-général</i>—a company of financiers
to whom the State conceded, for a fixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
annual sum, the right of collecting the indirect
taxes of the country. It was this connection
that brought Lavoisier to the scaffold during
the revolution of 1794. Like Stahl, Lavoisier
discovered no new substance; but, also like Stahl,
he created a new epoch by destroying the philosophical
system which Stahl had established.</p>

<p>It is commonly stated that the exception is
a proof of the rule. The history of science can
show many instances whereby the rule has been
demolished by the exception. Little facts have
killed big theories, even as a pebble has slain a
giant. During the reign of phlogiston a few of
such facts were not unknown—at least to some
of the better informed of Stahl’s followers.</p>

<p>Some of the alchemists had discovered that a
metal gained, not lost, weight by calcination. This
was known as far back as the sixteenth century.
It had been pointed out by Cardan and by Libavius.
Sulzbach showed that such was the case
with mercury. Boyle proved it in the case of
tin, and Rey in that of lead. Moreover, as
knowledge increased it became certain that
Stahl’s original conception of the principle of
combustion as a ponderable substance—he
imagined, with Becher, that it was of the nature
of an earth—was not tenable. The later
phlogistians were disposed to regard it as probably
identical with hydrogen. But even hydrogen
has weight, and facts seemed to require<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
that phlogiston, if it existed at all, should be
devoid of weight.</p>

<p>Towards the latter half of the eighteenth century
clearer views began to be held concerning
the relations of atmospheric air to the phenomena
of combustion and of calcination; many
half-forgotten facts relating to these phenomena
were recalled, and the inconsistencies and insufficiency
of phlogiston as a dogma became
gradually manifest. Three cardinal facts conspired
to bring about its overthrow—the isolation
of oxygen by Priestley; the recognition
by him of the nature of atmospheric air, and of
the fact that one of its constituents is oxygen;
and, lastly, the discovery by Cavendish that
water is a compound, and that its constituents
are oxygen and hydrogen. The significance of
these facts was first clearly grasped by Lavoisier,
and to him is due the credit of their true interpretation.
By reasoning and experiment he
proved conclusively that all ordinary phenomena
of burning are so many instances of the
combination of the oxygen of the air with the
combustible substance; that calcination is a process
of combination of the oxygen in the air with
the metal, which thereby increases in weight by
the amount of oxygen combined. Water—no
longer a simple substance—is formed by
the union, weight for weight, of oxygen and
hydrogen. Lavoisier’s reasoning was so sound<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
and his experimental evidence so complete that
his views gradually gained acceptance in France.
The phlogiston myth was thus exploded. Inspired
by Lavoisier, a small band of French
chemists—Berthollet, Fourcroy, Guyton de
Morveau—thereupon set to work to remodel
the system of chemistry and to recast its
nomenclature so as to eliminate all reference
to phlogiston. The very names “oxygen,” “hydrogen,”
“nitrogen,” corresponding respectively
to the “dephlogisticated air,” “phlogiston,” and
“phlogisticated air” of Priestley, were coined
by the new French school. For a time <i>le principe
oxygine</i> was regarded by this school in much
the same relation as phlogiston was regarded by
Stahl and his followers. The one fetich was
exchanged for the other. The combustible
principle—phlogiston—was renounced for the
acidifying principle—oxygen. The new chemistry
for a time centred itself round oxygen, just
as the old chemistry had centred itself round
phlogiston. The views of the French school met
with no immediate acceptance in Germany, the
home of phlogistonism, or in Sweden or England,
possibly owing, to some extent, to national prejudices.
The spirit of revolution, even although
it might be an intellectual revolution, had not
extended to these countries. Priestley, Cavendish,
and Scheele could not be induced to accept
the new doctrine. It was, however, accepted by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
Black, and its principles taught by him in Edinburgh;
and before the end of the century it had
practically supplanted phlogistonism in this
country. Some of those who, like Kirwan, had
energetically opposed the new theory ended by
enthusiastically embracing it. Its introduction
into Germany was mainly due to the influence of
Klaproth.</p>

<p>We further owe to Lavoisier the recognition
of the principle which lies at the basis of chemical
science—the principle of the conservation of
matter. Lavoisier was not the first to introduce
the use of the balance into chemistry: quantitative
chemistry did not actually originate with
him. Boyle, Black, and Cavendish, as a matter
of fact, preceded him in recognising the importance
of studying the quantitative relations of
substances. Nevertheless, no one before him
so clearly foreshadowed the doctrine of the
indestructibility of matter, and it was mainly
through his teaching that the balance came to
be recognised as indispensable to the pursuit of
chemistry. Before his untimely death he had
succeeded in impressing upon the science the
main features which at present characterise it.</p>

<p>Lavoisier was one of the most distinguished
men of his age, and his merits as a philosopher
were recognised throughout Europe. Indeed,
it is not too much to say that at the time of his
death he was the dominant figure in the chemical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
world of the eighteenth century. In addition to
his position as a member of the <i>Ferme-général</i>
he was made by Turgot a commissioner of the
<i>Régie des Poudres</i>; and in this capacity he
effected improvements in the manufacture and
refining of saltpetre, and greatly increased the
ballistic properties of gunpowder. He became
Secretary of the Committee of Agriculture, and
drew up reports on the cultivation of flax, of the
potato, and on the liming of wheat; he prepared
a scheme for the establishment of experimental
farms, and for the collection and distribution
of agricultural implements. He introduced
the cultivation of the beet root in the Blesois,
and improved the breed of sheep by the importation
of rams and ewes from Spain. He
was successively member of the Assembly of
the Orléanais, <i>Député suppléant</i> of the States-General,
and of the Commune of Paris. In 1791
he was named Secretary and Treasurer of the
famous Commission of Weights and Measures,
out of which grew the international system,
based theoretically on a natural unit, known as
the metric system, and now adopted by most
civilised countries in the world. He was not
only the administrative officer of the Commission:
he contributed to the nomenclature of the
system, and directed the determination of the
physical constants on which the measurements
rested, and especially the determination of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
weight of the unit volume of water on which the
value of the standard of mass was based. Lastly
he was Treasurer of the French Academy until
its suppression in 1793 by the Convention,
which shortly afterwards ordered the arrest of
Lavoisier and others of the Fermiers-généraux—twenty-eight
in all. They were sentenced
to be executed within twenty-four hours, and
their property confiscated. Coffinhal, who pronounced
their doom, declared: “<i>La republique n’a
pas besoin de savants</i>.” Thus in the fifty-first
year of his age, perished the creator of modern
chemistry—a victim to the senseless, sanguinary
fury of the “Friends of the People.” His
rectitude, his public services, the purity of his
private life, the splendour of his scientific
achievements—all were unheeded. As Lagrange
said to Delambre: “It required but a
moment to strike off this head; a hundred years
may not suffice to reproduce such another.”</p>

  <span class="subhead">in the Laboratory of the Sorbonne, Paris.</span></p></div></div>

<p>Of the men who were associated with Lavoisier
in the creation of what was known at the period
as the antiphlogistic chemistry, the most eminent
was Berthollet.</p>

<p><b>Claude-Louis Berthollet</b> was born in Savoy
in 1748, and, after a medical education, became
physician to the Duke of Orleans. Devoting
himself to chemistry, in 1781 he was made a
member of the Academy, and he became Government
Commissary and Director of the Gobelins,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
the chief tinctorial establishment of France.
Although in the main in agreement with
Lavoisier, he never wholly subscribed to the
idea that all acids contained oxygen. He discovered
the bleaching power of chlorine, prepared
potassium chlorate, and investigated prussic acid
and fulminating silver.</p>

<p>In his <i>Statique Chimique</i>, published in 1803, he
combated the partial and imperfect views of
Bergman and Geoffroy with regard to the operation
of chemical affinity, and showed that the
direction of a chemical change is modified by
the relative proportion of the reacting substances
and the physical conditions—temperature, pressure,
etc.—under which the change is effected.
He was one of the first to draw attention
to a class of phenomena known as reversible
reactions, and gave a number of instances
of their occurrence. Berthollet pushed his
conclusions so far that he was led to doubt
that chemical combination took place in fixed
and definite proportions; and his views gave rise
to a memorable controversy between him and
Proust, in which the latter eventually triumphed.</p>

<p>Berthollet enjoyed a great reputation in his
time, and played a considerable part in the
political history of his country. It was largely
to his zeal, sagacity, and skill in developing her
internal resources at a critical period when
she was hemmed round by foreign troops and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
her ports blockaded by British ships, that
France was saved from conquest. His life was
more than once in jeopardy when France was
governed by a Committee of Public Safety;
but his honesty, sincerity, and courage even
impressed Robespierre, and he escaped the
perils of the Great Terror. He was an intimate
friend of Napoleon, and accompanied him to
Egypt as a member of the Institute. He died
at Arcueil in 1822.</p>

<p>Davy, who visited him at his country house in
1813, says of <span class="locked">him:—</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Berthollet was a most amiable man; when
the friend of Napoleon, even, always good,
conciliatory, and modest, frank and candid.
He had no airs, and many graces. In every
way below La Place in intellectual powers, he
appeared superior to him in moral qualities.
Berthollet had no appearance of a man of
genius; but one could not look on La Place’s
physiognomy without being convinced that he
was a very extraordinary man.</p></blockquote>

<p>Other notable men of this period were Fourcroy,
Vauquelin, Klaproth, and Proust.</p>

<p><b>Antoine-François Fourcroy</b>, the son of a
pharmacist, was born at Paris in 1755, and
started his career as a dramatic author. On the
advice of Vicq d’Azir, the anatomist, he turned
to medicine, and in 1784, by the influence of
Buffon, obtained the chair of Chemistry at the
Jardin du Roi, in succession to Macquer. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
was an excellent teacher—clear, orderly, and
methodical. He had, indeed, a talent for oratory.
This he assiduously cultivated, and became
one of the most popular lecturers of his
time in France. Ambitious and time-serving,
he became embroiled in the turbulent politics
of the period, and, after a chequered career,
died, embittered and disappointed, in the fifty-fourth
year of his age. His chief services to
science consisted in his works, <i>Système des
Connaissances Chimiques</i> and <i>Philosophie Chimique</i>.
These, no less than his public lectures, did
much to popularise the doctrines of Lavoisier
among his countrymen.</p>

<p><b>Louis Nicolas Vauquelin</b>, the son of a Norman
peasant, was born in 1763, and while a boy
became assistant to an apothecary in Rouen.
In 1780 he came to Paris, and entered Fourcroy’s
laboratory. Much of the experimental work
published in Fourcroy’s name was actually done
by Vauquelin. He became a member of the
Academy in 1791, Professor of Chemistry at
the Mining School, Assayer to the Mint, and
subsequently Professor of Chemistry at the
Jardin des Plantes. On Fourcroy’s death he was
made Professor of Chemistry of the Medical
Faculty of Paris. Vauquelin was no theorist;
he was, however, an excellent practical chemist,
and one of the best analysts of the period. He
made a large number of mineral analyses, more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
particularly for Hauy, the crystallographer. He
discovered the element <i>chromium</i> in the so-called
red-lead ore (lead chromate) from Siberia.
He also first made known the existence of
<i>glucinum</i> in beryl. He described a method of
separating the platinum metals, and worked
upon <i>iridium</i> and <i>osmium</i>. He investigated the
<i>hyposulphites</i>, <i>cyanates</i>, and <i>malates</i>. He discovered
the presence of <i>benzoic acid</i> in the
urine of animals; with Robiqet, he first isolated
<i>asparagin</i>; with Buniva, <i>allantoic acid</i>; and with
Bouillon de la Grange, <i>camphoric acid</i>.</p>

<p>Vauquelin lived wholly for science, and had
no other interests than in his laboratory. He
was pensioned in 1822, and died at his birthplace—St.
André d’Héberlot—in the sixty-sixth
year of his age.</p>

<p><b>Martin Heinrich Klaproth</b>, born in 1743 at
Wernigerode, in the Hartz, began life, like Vauquelin,
as an apothecary’s apprentice at Quedlinburg.
Thence he went to Hanover, and ultimately
to Berlin, where he studied under Pott and Marggraf
and entered the pharmacy of Valentine
Rose, father of Heinrich Rose, the distinguished
chemist, and Gustav Rose, the mineralogist. In
1788 he became a member of the Berlin Academy,
and, on the creation of the Berlin University in
1809, was made Professor of Chemistry. As
already stated, he was the first chemist of eminence
in Germany to adopt the antiphlogistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
theory. He was distinguished as an analyst.
He discovered <i>tellurium</i>, analysed <i>pitchblende</i>
and <i>uranit</i>, and first made known the existence
of <i>uranium</i>, <i>zirconium</i>, and <i>cerium</i>, which he
termed “ochroita.” He analysed <i>corundum</i>,
and was an independent discoverer of <i>titanium</i>
and <i>glucinum</i>, termed by him <i>beryllium</i>. He
made a large number of analyses of minerals,
such as leucite, chrysoberyl, hyacinth, granite,
olivin, wolfram, malachite, pyromorphite, etc.
He continued actively at work until his death,
in the seventy-fourth year of his age.</p>

<p>Analytical chemistry is under great obligations
to Klaproth. He established a standard of
accuracy never before approached; and much
of his analytical work, both as regards processes
and results, is of permanent value.</p>

<p><b>Joseph Louis Proust</b>, the son of a pharmacist
was born at Angers in 1761. He received his
early training in chemistry from his father, and,
after studying under Rouelle in Paris, obtained
an appointment at the Salpetrière. Proust has
the credit of being the first chemist to make a
balloon ascent—in a Montgolfier balloon with
Pilatre de Rozier. On the invitation of the King
of Spain, he went to that country to superintend
certain chemical manufacturing processes. He
became Professor of Chemistry at the University
of Salamanca, and subsequently went to Madrid,
where he was installed in a well-equipped laboratory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
to enable him to examine the mineral riches
of Spain. On the breaking out of war his work
was interrupted, and he was obliged to leave Madrid.
His laboratory was completely destroyed,
and his valuable collection of apparatus and
specimens dissipated. Through the good offices
of Berthollet, Proust was offered a considerable
sum of money by Napoleon in order to
induce him to turn his discovery of grape sugar
to practical account. Proust was, however,
too broken in health to undertake the work of
a factory manager, and he retired to Mayence.
On the restoration of the Monarchy he was
made a member of the French Academy, his
honorarium as an Academician being augmented
by a pension from Louis XVIII. He died in
1826, while on a visit to Angers, his native place.</p>

<p>Proust is the discoverer of what is now styled
“the law of constant proportion,” which states
that the same body is invariably composed of
the same elements, united in the same proportion.
He was a skilful analyst, and made numerous
analyses of minerals; and he was one of the
earliest to undertake a systematic study of
metallic salts of organic acids.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Atomic Theory</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> opening years of the nineteenth century
were made memorable by the promulgation
of the atomic theory by John Dalton. The
enunciation of this theory, which affords a simple
and adequate explanation of the fundamental
laws of chemical combination, marks an epoch
in the history of chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be desirable to trace, as briefly as
possible, the successive steps which led up to the
generalisation which more than any other has
served to stamp chemistry as an exact science.
That matter was <i>discrete</i>—that is, that it was
not continuous, but was composed of ultimate
particles—was, as already stated, imagined by
the ancients, and was part of the philosophy of
Leukippus, Demokritus, and Leucretius. But
this supposition, although favoured by Newton
and other thinkers, had little or no scientific
basis prior to the middle of the eighteenth century.
From that time onward a variety of
chemical facts gradually accumulated, many of
which at the time of their discovery had no
obvious connection with pre-existing facts. It
was reserved for Dalton to point out how an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
extension and more precise definition of the
old doctrine would suffice to connect and explain
them.</p>

<p>The first germ of an atomic theory based on
chemical fact may be traced in the observation
of <b>Toburn Bergmann</b> (b. 1735, d. 1784),
Professor of Chemistry at Upsala, that neutral
solutions of certain metals in contact with other
metals gave a precipitate without the neutrality
of the solution being disturbed, and without gas
being evolved. One metal had simply replaced
the other in solution. Bergmann thus incidentally
discovered the fact of the chemical equivalence
of metals. He was of opinion, however,
that the phenomenon meant a transference of
phlogiston from one metal to another, and that
the process might be made a mode of determining
the relative amount of phlogiston in
various metals. Lavoisier extended Bergmann’s
observations, and sought to show, in effect, that
the process afforded a means of determining the
amounts of the several metals which combined
with one and the same quantity of oxygen. But
neither Bergmann nor Lavoisier really grasped
the idea of equivalence as we understand it
to-day. It began to be appreciated as the result
of the work of <b>Jeremiah Benjamin Richter</b>
(b. 1762, d. 1807) and of <b>G. E. Fischer</b> on the
mutual action of salts in solutions, and on the
determinations of the amounts of acid and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
bases which respectively combine with one
another. Methods of measurement of the
proportions in which substances combine were
grouped by Richter under the term <i>Stochiometry</i>.</p>

<p>However desirable it may be in the interests
of history to indicate the sequence of the surmises
and facts which preceded the formulation
of the atomic theory, it is very doubtful whether
Dalton was, to any material extent, influenced
by them. A self-educated man of lowly origin,
sturdily independent and highly original, he was
accustomed to rely upon his own faculty of
observation and experiment for his facts, and
upon his own intellectual powers and mental
energy for their interpretation.</p>

<p><b>John Dalton</b>, the son of a Quaker hand-loom
weaver, was born at Eaglesfield, in Cumberland,
in 1766. While still a boy he took to school-teaching,
and acquired, in his leisure and by
his own exertions, a competent knowledge of
mathematics and physical science. In 1793 he
was called to give instruction in mathematics,
natural philosophy, and chemistry at the
Manchester New College, the Nonconformist
academy—now moved from Warrington—in
which Priestley had formerly lectured. Here
he remained six years, leaving the college to
take up an independent position as a private
tutor, so as to enable him the more freely to
pursue his scientific inquiries. In 1800 he became<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
Secretary of the Philosophical Society of
Manchester, and remained connected, as an
official, with that institution until his death in
1844. The greater number of his scientific
communications were published by that society.
In the outset of his scientific career he was
attracted to meteorology; and it was probably
its problems which led him in the first place to
experiment, and to speculate on the physical
constitution of gases. In the course of these
observations he was led to the discovery of the
law of thermal expansion of gases, with which his
name is now generally associated. His speculations
concerning the physical constitution of
gaseous substances, arising from the contemplation
of gaseous phenomena, led him to the conception
that a gas is composed of particles that
repel one another with a force decreasing as the
distance of their centres from each other; and
it is probable that in this manner he familiarised
himself with the idea of the existence of atoms.
His first insight into the laws of the chemical
combination of these atoms seems to have
originated from his discovery that, when two
substances unite in different proportions, these
proportions may be expressed in simple multiples
of whole numbers. Thus he found, on
examining the composition of marsh gas and of
ethylene, both hydrocarbons, that for the same
weight of hydrogen there was twice the amount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
of carbon in ethylene that there was in marsh
gas. He then examined the oxides of nitrogen,
and found a similar regularity to hold good
in these compounds. Some time prior to the
autumn of 1803 Dalton was led to the supposition
that these regularities could be satisfactorily
explained by the assumption that matter is
composed of atoms having sizes and weights
differing with each substance, but of identical
weight and size for any particular substance,
and that chemical combination consists in the
approximation of these atoms. This simple
hypothesis explained all the facts then known.
It explained the constancy in the chemical
composition of substances, which may be said to
have been established by Proust, and which is
now formulated as the Law of Constant Proportion—that
the same body is invariably composed
of the same elements, united in the same
proportion. It explained also the fact discovered
by Dalton that, when an element unites
with another in different proportions, the higher
proportions are multiples of the lowest—now
formulated as the Law of Multiple Proportion.
It further explained the fact, which may be
said to have been foreshadowed by Richter,
that when two bodies, A and B, separately
combine with a third body, C, the proportions
of A and B which unite with C are measures or
multiples of the proportions in which A and B<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
combine together. This is known as the Law of
Reciprocal Proportion.</p>

<p>Dalton’s theory was first made generally
known by Thomas Thomson, in the third edition
of his <i>System of Chemistry</i>, published in 1807,
and was employed by Thomson in his paper on
“The Oxalates of Strontium,” published the
same year in the <i>Philosophical Transactions</i>.
The first printed account by Dalton himself is
contained in Part I. of his <i>New System of
Chemical Philosophy</i>, published in 1808, the
substance of which had been previously given
in a course of lectures at the Royal Institution,
London, and subsequently repeated in Edinburgh
and Glasgow.</p>

<p>The statement of his theory is contained in
chapter iii. of this work, under the heading “Of
Chemical Synthesis,” and is accompanied by
a plate and explanation, of which a facsimile is
given on pp. 130–1.</p>

<p>The facts upon which Dalton based his theory
are incontrovertible; but Dalton’s explanation
of them was not universally accepted at the
time he gave it. Davy, who, of course, was
familiar with the conception of atoms as part
of the Newtonian philosophy, objected to the
term “atomic weight” introduced by Dalton,
and suggested the expression “combining proportion”;
and Wollaston, for similar reasons,
proposed the term “equivalent,” as denoting
the constant quantity with which bodies went
in and out of combination. There is no doubt
that the use of these terms retarded the general
acceptance of Dalton’s doctrine, and, moreover,
brought into the science a confusion which was
not finally dispelled, as we shall see, until during
the second half of the century.</p>

Dalton’s estimations of the relative weights of
the atoms, or, to use Davy’s phrase, the values
of their combining proportions, were, as might
be expected, very rough approximations to the
truth. This arose partly from inadequate experimental
data, and partly from uncertainty
as to the relative number of the constituent
atoms which made up a compound. Neither
Dalton nor his immediate successors had any
rational or consistent method of determining
the latter point. The view taken of the composition
of the compound decided what particular
multiples or sub-multiples of the values
of the atomic weights of its constituents were to
be adopted. As Dalton, in many cases, had no
real criterion to guide him, he made the simplest
possible assumptions; but these might or might
not be valid; and subsequent experience showed
that in some cases they were erroneous.</p>

<p>It was, however, generally recognised that
these atomic weights, combining proportions, or
equivalents, as they were for a time indifferently
termed, were chemical constants of the highest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
importance, both to the scientific chemist, who,
apart from their theoretic interest, had need of
them in the course of quantitative analysis, and
to the manufacturing chemist, who required
them for the intelligent exercise of his operations;
and accordingly a number of chemists, very
shortly after the promulgation of Dalton’s theory,
attempted to determine their values with all
possible precision. Chief among these was the
Swedish chemist Berzelius, to whom science was
indebted for a series of estimations of atomic
weights, which were long regarded as models of
quantitative accuracy, and stamped their author
as the greatest master of determinative chemistry
of his age.</p>

<p><b>Jöns Jakob Berzelius</b>, the son of a schoolmaster,
was born near Linköping, in East Gothland,
Sweden, in 1779. Entering Upsala with
a view to the profession of medicine, he was
attracted, under the influence of Afzelius—or,
rather, in spite of it—to the study of chemistry,
and, later, of voltaic electricity, then in its infancy.
While holding a number of minor appointments
as a teacher of medicine, pharmacy,
physics, and chemistry, he was elected, in 1808,
a member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences,
of which he became President in 1810. In 1818
he was made permanent Secretary of the Academy,
and, by means of a yearly subsidy, was
enabled to devote himself wholly to experimental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
science. He was ennobled in 1818, and on the
occasion of his marriage, in 1835, was created a
baron of the Scandinavian kingdom. He died
in 1848.</p>

<p>Berzelius occupies a pre-eminent position in
the history of chemistry, and during a considerable
portion of his lifetime exercised an almost
unassailable authority as a chemical philosopher.
He is distinguished as an experimenter, as a
discoverer, as a critic and interpreter, and as a
lawgiver. His contributions to chemical knowledge
range over every department of the science.
He shares with Davy the honour of having established
the fundamental laws of electro-chemistry.
His experimental work on the atomic
weights of the elements—the great work of his
life—was of supreme importance at this particular
period of the development of chemistry:
it served not only to give precision to, and
enhance the significance and value of, Dalton’s
generalisation, but it furnished chemists, for the
first time, with a set of constants, ascertained
with the highest exactitude of which operative
chemistry was then capable, thereby contributing
to the expansion of quantitative
analysis, and to a more exact knowledge of the
composition of substances. Berzelius, indeed,
was an analyst of the first rank—conscientious,
patient, and painstaking; an ingenious and skilful
manipulator; inventive and resourceful.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
What determinative chemistry owes to his labours,
and not less to his example, is obvious
from even the most superficial examination of its
literature during the first third of the last century.</p>

<p>As a discoverer, Berzelius first made known the
existence of <i>cerium</i> (1803), of <i>selenium</i> (1818),
and of <i>thorium</i> (1828); and he prepared and investigated
a large number of their combinations.
He isolated <i>silicon</i> (1823), <i>zirconium</i> (1824),
<i>tantalum</i> (1824), and studied the compounds
of <i>vanadium</i>, discovered by his countryman
Sefström. He largely extended our knowledge
of groups of substances in which sulphur replaces
oxygen; investigated compounds of fluorine
(1824), platinum (1828), and tellurium (1831–1833),
and made many analyses of minerals,
meteorites, and mineral-waters. He discovered
<i>racemic acid</i> and investigated the ferrocyanides.
It was his investigation of racemic acid—which
has the same percentage composition as
tartaric acid—that first enabled him to grasp
the conception of <i>isomerism</i>, a term which we
owe to him, and of <i>metamerism</i> and <i>polymerism</i>.
He was the first to study the phenomena of
contact-actions, which he comprehended under
the term <i>catalysis</i>.</p>

<p>As an author his literary activity was astonishing.
His new system of mineralogy marks
an epoch in the history of that branch of science.
His text-book on chemistry was long the leading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
manual, and went through many editions, being
constantly revised by him. His annual reports
on the progress of physics and chemistry extended
to twenty-seven volumes and constitute
a monument to his industry, thoroughness,
perspicacity, and critical ability.</p>

<p>Although holding no university appointment,
and with a laboratory of the most modest
dimensions and character, Berzelius, exercised
great influence as a teacher. Some of the most
notable chemists of the last century, such as
Heinrich and Gustav Rose, Dulong, Mitscherlich,
Wöhler, Chr. Gmelin, and Mosander, were among
his pupils; and many of them have testified to
his stimulating power as an investigator of
nature, and to his merits as a worthy, genial
man.</p>

<p>The reasonableness of Dalton’s conjecture
received further support from the discovery by
Gay Lussac in 1808, that gases always combine
in simple proportions by volume, and that the
volume of the gaseous product formed, when
measured under comparable conditions of temperature
and pressure, stands in a simple
relation to the volumes of the constituents. The
law of pressure discovered by Boyle, that of
thermal expansion by Dalton, and of volumes
by Gay Lussac (which, it ought to be stated,
was previously and independently made by
Dalton), are explained on the assumption that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
equal numbers of the particles—either as
simple particles or as compound particles—are
present in the same volume of the gas.
This method of explanation was first clearly
stated by the Italian physicist <b>Avogadro</b> in
1811, but its significance, as will be seen
subsequently, was not appreciated until half
a century later.</p>

<p>As the values for the atomic weights gradually
became more exact, speculations arose as to the
significance of the numerical relations which were
observed to exist among them. In 1815
<b>William Prout</b> threw out the supposition that
the atomic weights of the gaseous elements are
multiples by whole numbers of that of hydrogen.
Extended into a generalisation, this might be
held to indicate that all kinds of matter are so
many forms of a primordial substance. Subsequent
inquiry showed that Prout’s “Law,” as
it is sometimes called, was not tenable in its
original form. Certain elements, it was conclusively
proved, had atomic weights which were
not whole numbers. Dumas subsequently modified
the law, after a redetermination of a large
number of atomic weights, by assuming that
the substance common to the so-called elements
had a lower atomic weight than unity. Although
there are a considerable number of
elements whose atomic weights, based upon the
most accurate determinations, are remarkably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
close to whole numbers, the investigations of
Stas and others afford no valid reason for believing
that Prout’s hypothesis, and the underlying
supposition to which it has been held to
point, are justified by experimental evidence.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> first year of the nineteenth century is
further memorable on account of the invention
of the voltaic pile, and by reason of its
application by <b>William Nicholson</b> and <b>Sir
Anthony Carlisle</b> to the electrolytic decomposition
of water. This mode of resolving water
into its constituents made a great sensation at
the time, mainly because of the extraordinary
method by which it was effected. It afforded
an independent and unlooked-for proof of the
compound nature of water by a method altogether
differing in principle from that by which
its composition had been previously ascertained.
The formation of water by the combustion of
hydrogen brought no conviction of its real
nature to a confirmed phlogistian like Priestley;
and it is even doubtful whether Cavendish ever
fully realised the true significance of his great
discovery. But the fact that the quantitative
results of the analysis thus effected were identical
with those of its synthesis, as made by Cavendish
and Lavoisier, admitted of only one interpretation.
This cardinal discovery may be said
to have completed the downfall of phlogiston.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
The value of the voltaic pile as an analytical
agent was nowhere more quickly appreciated
than in England. In the hands of Humphry
Davy its application to the analysis of the
alkalis and alkaline earths led to discoveries of
the greatest magnitude.</p>

<p><b>Humphry Davy</b> was born in Penzance in 1778.
In the course of his studies for the profession of
medicine he was attracted to chemistry; and he
became chemical assistant to Dr. Beddoes, a
former teacher of chemistry at Oxford, but then
living at Clifton, near Bristol. While in the
capacity of assistant and operator in Beddoes’s
Pneumatical Institute, Davy discovered the
intoxicating properties of <i>nitrous oxide</i> (so called
laughing gas), which brought him into prominence
and led to his engagement by the managers
of the newly-created Royal Institution in London
as lecturer in chemistry in succession to Garnett.
He early began to experiment on galvanism,
and soon succeeded in developing the fundamental
laws of electro-chemistry; and in 1807 he
effected the <i>decomposition of potash and soda</i> by
the application of voltaic electricity—thereby
establishing, what indeed had been surmised
previously, that the alkalis are compound substances.
He subsequently proved that this was
also the case with the alkaline earths. Davy
thus added some five or six metallic elements
to those already known.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
These discoveries, perhaps the most brilliant
of their time, afforded additional evidence of the
invalidity of Lavoisier’s assumption that oxygen,
as the name implies, was the “principle of
acidity.” The surmise, in fact, was already
disproved by the case of water—a neutral
substance and devoid of all the recognised
attributes of an acid. It was still further disproved
by the cases of potash and soda—strongly
alkaline compounds.</p>

<p>Additional evidence was adduced by Davy
in demonstrating, in 1810, that the so-called
<i>oxymuriatic acid</i>, the <i>dephlogisticated marine
acid</i> discovered by Scheele, contained no oxygen,
but was a simple, indivisible substance. For
the old designation, which connoted a compound
body, he substituted the name <i>chlorine</i>, in
allusion to the characteristic colour of the
element. In the course of his investigation on
this substance he discovered the <i>penta- and
trichloride of phosphorus</i>, <i>chlorophosphamide</i> and
<i>chlorine peroxide</i>. He was also the discoverer of
<i>telluretted hydrogen</i> and an independent discoverer
of <i>nitrosulphonic acid</i>.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p><span class="smcap">Sir Humphry Davy.</span><br />
  <span class="subhead">From a painting by Lawrence in the possession of the Royal Society.</span></p></div></div>

<p>He worked on <i>iodine</i> and the <i>iodates</i>, on the
<i>diamond</i>, on the so-called <i>fuming liquor of Cadet</i>,
on <i>nitrogen chloride</i>, and on the <i>pigments of the
ancients</i>. Lastly, he invented the <i>miner’s
safety lamp</i>, with which his name will always be
associated, effecting thereby what was practically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
a revolution in coal-mining. He became
President of the Royal Society in 1820, and died
at Geneva on May 29th, 1829, in the fifty-first
year of his age. Davy was a singularly gifted
man, of great mental vigour and imaginative
power; quick, lively and ingenious; an eloquent
teacher and a daring and brilliant experimenter.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy name in the chemical
history of this period is Wollaston. <b>William
Hyde Wollaston</b>, born at East Dereham, in
Norfolk, in 1766, was educated at Cambridge
with a view to the profession of medicine, but,
failing to secure a practice, he devoted himself
to the pursuit of science, and especially to optics
and chemistry. He devised a method of
<i>working platinum</i>, and was the first to make
known the existence of <i>palladium</i> and <i>rhodium</i>.
He was one of the most ingenious and acute
analysts of his time, and possessed remarkable
inventive powers. He investigated the nature
of <i>urinary calculi</i> and <i>chalk stones</i>. His paper on
the <i>oxalates of potash</i> was of great service at the
time as a demonstration of the law of multiple
proportions. He first drew attention to the
existence in the solar spectrum of what were
subsequently termed the <i>Fraunhofer lines</i>; and
he invented the <i>reflecting goniometer</i> and the
<i>camera lucida</i>, and a <i>slide rule</i> for chemical
calculations. He resembled Cavendish in temperament
and mental habitudes, and, like him,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
was distinguished for the range and exactitude
of his scientific knowledge, his habitual caution,
and his cold and reserved disposition. He died
in 1828.</p>

<p>Almost immediately after the publication of
Volta’s discovery attempts were made—notably
by Berzelius in Sweden and by Davy in England—to
prove that electrical and chemical phenomena
are correlated and mutually dependent.
This assumption was more fully worked out by
Berzelius in 1812, and it served as the basis of
a chemical system which exercised considerable
influence on chemical doctrine during the first
half of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Berzelius assumed that electric polarity was an
attribute of all atoms—that these were bipolar,
in fact, but that in them either positive or negative
electricity predominated. Hence the elements
were capable of being divided into two
classes—that is, positive or negative, depending
upon the excess of either charge. Which of the
electricities predominated might be ascertained
by determining the particular pole at which the
element was separated on electrolysis. Combinations
of dissimilar elements—or, in other
words, chemical compounds—were also endowed
with polarity. The chemical affinities of
elements and compounds were related to the excess
of either kind of electricity resident in them;
and chemical combination resulted from, and was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
a consequence of, the more or less perfect neutralisation
of the two kinds. From a study of
the electrical deportment of the elements Berzelius
sought to arrange them in series, starting
with oxygen as the most electro-negative member.</p>

<p>These conceptions were employed by him as
the basis of a method of classification. The attempt
is historically interesting as being the first
systematic endeavour to gain an insight into the
constitution of chemical compounds—that is, to
determine the manner in which the constituent
atoms are grouped or arranged with respect to
one another, or, in other words, to distinguish
between the empirical and the rational composition
of substances, which is the ultimate aim of
modern chemistry.</p>

<p>A necessary consequence of these views was
that every compound was to be considered as
made up of two parts in electrically different
states. Thus baryta, consisted of a combination
of the electro-positive barium, combined with
the electro-negative oxygen; it combined with
sulphuric oxide because the preponderating
positive electricity it contained met with the
negative electricity which prevailed in the sulphuric
oxide. Generalising, it may be said that
the basic oxides are invariably the positive constituents
of salts, whereas the acid oxides are
the negative constituents, as proved by the
mode in which the two kinds of oxides separated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
at the poles on electrolysis. Barium
sulphate, then, was to be regarded as made up
of two entities—BaO and SO<sub>3</sub>—and hence
was to be called sulphate of baryta. Berzelius
extended this conception in order to explain
the formation of double salts—such, for example,
as potash alum, which he regarded
as a binary compound of positive potassium
sulphate and negative aluminium sulphate, each
of which, in its turn, could be resolved into an
acidic and a basic oxide of opposite electricities.</p>

<p>The dualistic notions of Berzelius led him to
the construction of a system of chemical nomenclature
and notation which, in its main features,
has persisted to this day, and is universally
current, with certain modifications, in modern
chemical literature. We owe to him the grouping
of the elements into metals and metalloids,
and also our present system of symbolic notation,
whereby even complicated chemical reactions
may be expressed in a concise and intelligible
manner. Chemical symbols were used by the
alchemists; but Berzelius first suggested that a
chemical symbol should not only represent the
element to which it refers, but also its relative
atomic weight. Chemical equations became
quantitative as well as qualitative expressions
of the facts they denote. Such equations implicitly
assumed that, to use Davy’s words,
chemistry had passed under the dominion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
mathematical sciences. Professed mathematicians
were, however, slow to recognise that the
phenomena of chemical action were capable of
formal mathematical treatment. Davy relates
that on speaking to Laplace of the atomic theory
in chemistry, and expressing his belief that the
science would ultimately be referred to mathematical
laws similar to those he had so profoundly
and successfully established with respect
to the mechanical properties of matter, the idea
was treated in a tone bordering on contempt.</p>

<p>Berzelius’s electro-chemical system, and the
dualistic ideas associated with it, were of considerable
service when applied to the inorganic
branch of the science; but attempts to fit them to
the facts of organic chemistry, which began to
accumulate rapidly after the first quarter of the
century, failed. Its inadequacy as a comprehensive
generalisation became more and more
manifest, and it eventually fell. In fact, it may
be said to have received its death-blow by Davy’s
discovery of the elementary nature of chlorine,
and by the recognition of the fact that the acids
do not necessarily contain oxygen. Davy and,
later, Dulong made it obvious that, if any one
element was to be regarded as the acidifying
principle, it was hydrogen, and not oxygen; and,
in a sense, this view ultimately prevailed in the
recognition of the acids as salts of hydrogen.</p>

<p>In France the study of electro-chemistry was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
undertaken by Gay Lussac and Thénard, largely
owing to the action of the Emperor Napoleon,
who furnished the funds for the construction of
a powerful galvanic battery. The results were
published, in 1811, under the title, <i>Recherches
Physico-Chimiques, faites sur la Pile</i>, etc. Gay
Lussac, whose name has already been mentioned
as one of the discoverers of the Law
of Combination of Gases, played a considerable
part in the history of chemistry at this period.
He was one of the earliest to appreciate the importance
of Dalton’s generalisation, and to point
out the significance of his own discovery in
strengthening it. He was probably led, in the first
instance, to the recognition of the law of gaseous
combination by Berthollet’s work on the volumetric
composition of ammonia gas, and by his own
discovery—made in 1805, in conjunction with
Humboldt, in the course of their analysis of
atmospheric air—that one volume of oxygen
combined with exactly two volumes of hydrogen
to form water. The regularities thus indicated
he found to be general: all gases which are capable
of chemical union combine in simple proportions
by volume, and the volume of the product, if a
gas, always stands in some simple relation to the
volumes of the constituents.</p>

<p><b>Joseph Louis Gay Lussac</b> was born in 1778,
at Saint Leonard, studied chemistry in Paris,
and was associated in chemical inquiry with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Berthollet. As Eleve-Ingenieur in the École
Nationale des Ponts et des Chaussées he began
the experimental work in physics and chemistry
upon which his fame rests. In 1804 he undertook,
with Biot, a series of balloon ascents for
the purpose of investigating the physics and
chemistry of the upper regions of the atmosphere.
In 1806 he became Professor of Chemistry at
the École Polytechnique, and in 1832 Professor
at the Jardin des Plantes. He was one of the
chief assayers of the French Mint, and, as member
of many commissions, exerted considerable influence
in official circles. He died in 1850.</p>

<p>Gay Lussac and Thénard were the first to
devise a method of obtaining potassium and
sodium by a purely chemical process, whereby
these metals could be procured in far larger quantities
than was at that time possible by electrolytic
means. They were thus enabled to make
use of the strong deoxidising power of these
metals to effect a number of reductions, notably
that of boric oxide to <i>boron</i>. Gay Lussac and
Thénard were also the first to make known the
existence of <i>boron fluoride</i>. We further owe to
Gay Lussac the discovery of <i>cyanogen</i>, the first
of the so-called compound radicals. He first
prepared ethyl iodide, investigated sulphovinic
acid and grape sugar, studied etherification and
fermentation, etc. We are also indebted to him
for a method of determining vapour densities<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
which proved of great service in ascertaining the
molecular weights of substances. He worked
on iodine and its compounds, discovered, with
Welter, <i>thiosulphuric</i> acid, and investigated
fulminic acid in collaboration with Liebig.</p>

<p>Among his services to analytical chemistry
were his method for the analysis of gunpowder,
his volumetric estimation of silver (wet silver
assay), chlorometric analysis, alkalimetry, etc.
He devised the system still in use in France for
the estimation of alcohol in spirits of wine.</p>

<p><b>Louis Jacques Thénard</b> was born in 1777 at
Nogent-Sur-Seine, and was a pupil of Vauquelin
and of Berthollet. In 1797 he became <i>repétiteur</i>
at the Polytechnic School of Paris, and eventually
its professor. He subsequently occupied
the chair of chemistry at the Collège de France,
and of the Faculty of Science of the University
of Paris. He was ennobled by Charles X. in
1824, and died at Paris in the eightieth year of
his age.</p>

<p>In addition to his work with Gay Lussac
already mentioned, we owe to Thénard the
discovery of <i>hydrogen peroxide</i> and <i>hydrogen
persulphide</i>. Together with Dulong he studied
the catalytic action of platinum on mixtures of
oxygen and hydrogen. He investigated the
fatty acids, and worked on fermentation and on
ether-formation; and he was the first to isolate
citric and malic acids. He also occupied himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
with the chemistry of bile, perspiration,
albumen, the acids of urine and milk, and with
the theory of mordants.</p>

<p>In 1834 Faraday made known the important
fact that on passing the same galvanic current
through a number of electrolytes—water,
hydrochloric acid, solutions of metallic chloride—these
were decomposed in such manner that
definite amounts of hydrogen or metal were
separated at the negative pole, and corresponding
amounts of oxygen or chlorine were evolved
at the positive pole. These observations were
comprehended by Faraday under his “law
of definite electrolytic action.” The electro-chemical
equivalents thus obtained were in some
cases identical with the atomic weights deduced
by Berzelius; in others they were not; but,
nevertheless, when they differed, they stood in
some simple relation to the assumed atomic
weight. The significance of Faraday’s observation
was not lost sight of, although his anticipation
that the determination of electro-chemical
equivalents would be of use in fixing atomic
weights was not immediately appreciated. A
clear distinction between the <i>equivalent</i>, the <i>atom</i>,
and the <i>molecule</i> was not then apprehended.
As will be subsequently shown, it was only
during the latter half of the nineteenth century
that the discrepancies and inconsistencies thus
revealed were definitely reconciled and cleared up.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">As</span> the horizon of chemistry widened and its
operations extended, it became necessary
to treat its subject-matter methodically. Accordingly
attempts were made in the various
systematic treatises which began to appear in
the seventeenth century to group its facts into
an orderly and rational arrangement. One of
the earliest of such systematic treatises was the
<i>Cours de Chimie</i> of Nicolas Lemery, published
in 1675. Although this work was styled by
Boerhaave “a tumultuary mass of pharmaceutical
processes, without any certain design
or coherence,” it is noteworthy as being the
first of its kind to divide the science into its
present main branches of inorganic and organic
chemistry.</p>

<p>It may be desirable to indicate, as briefly as
possible, the general state of knowledge respecting
the chemistry of organic substances down to
the early years of the last century. As already
mentioned, such substances as acetic acid,
turpentine, starch, sugar, certain dye stuffs, and
oils, had long been known; and such processes
as saponification and fermentation had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
practised from very early times. The alchemists
had prepared a variety of essential oils,
aliphatic ethers, and esters; and the iatro-chemists
had obtained benzoic and succinic acids,
and acetic acid from wood. Milk sugar was
first prepared by Fabrizio Bartoletti in 1619.
Grape sugar was first mentioned as occurring
in honey by Glauber in 1660. Boyle first
detected the presence of a spirit among the
products of the destructive distillation of wood.
Few of the followers of Stahl occupied themselves
with organic products; and it was only
towards the end of the phlogistic period that
attention was once more directed to products of
animal and vegetable origin. Scheele isolated
glycerin in 1784, and obtained <i>ethyl chloride</i> by
the distillation of a mixture of common salt,
pyrolusite, oil of vitriol, and alcohol. <i>Ethyl
acetate</i> was first prepared by Lauraquais in 1759.
Arvidson obtained <i>ethyl formate</i> in 1777. <i>Oxalic
ether</i> was first made by Savary in 1773. What
was long known as <i>oil of wine</i> appears to have
been first mentioned by Libavius, but its true
nature was discovered by Hennel in 1826. The
formation of <i>aldehyde</i> was first recognised by
Scheele in 1774, and it was in turn investigated
by Fourcroy and Vauquelin, Döbereiner, and
Gay Lussac; but it was first definitely isolated
in 1835 by Liebig, who gave it its name.</p>

<p>The first organic acid known was vinegar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
(acetic acid), and for a long time all naturally
occurring organic acids having a sour taste were
regarded as identical with or as forms of vinegar.
It was only during the second half of the eighteenth
century that it was clearly ascertained
that a variety of organic acids exist, perfectly
distinct from acetic acid. <i>Glacial acetic acid</i>
was first obtained by Löwiz in 1789. Acetic
acid, as a product of the destructive distillation
of wood, was first obtained by Göttling in 1779.
The acetic fermentation has been studied from
very early times. Surmises as to the mode in
which wine was converted into vinegar are to
be met with in the works of Basil Valentine,
Becher (1669), Lemery (1675), and Stahl (1667).
Priestley, for a time, held the opinion that
vinegar contained a vegetable acid air, but he
subsequently discovered and corrected his error.
The direct conversion of spirit of wine (ethyl
alcohol) into acetic acid was studied by Lavoisier
and Berthollet, who first clearly recognised that
it was a process of oxidation. The quantitative
composition of acetic acid was first established
by Berzelius in 1814. Many of the acetates have
been known from early times. <i>Verdigris</i> is mentioned
by Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and Pliny.
<i>Zinc acetate</i> was known to Geber, and <i>potassium
acetate</i> to Pliny, who mentions its use in medicine.
<i>Ammonium acetate</i> was also used in medicine as
far back as the beginning of the seventeenth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
century, and was particularly recommended by
the physician, Raymond Minderer. <i>Sodium
acetate</i> was prepared by Duhamel in 1736.
<i>Lead acetate</i> was known in the fifteenth century,
and was styled by Libavius <i>saccharum plumbi
quintessentiale</i>, in allusion to its sweet taste.
What was called by the alchemists <i>lac virginis</i>
was a turbid solution of basic lead acetate, and
it was frequently used in medicine, more particularly
by Goulard in 1760. What we now call
<i>acetone</i> was first observed by Libavius, in 1595,
and subsequently by Boyle, during the destructive
distillation of lead acetate: its formation
from other acetates was noticed by Trommsdorff,
Derosne, and Chenevix, by whom it was termed
pyroacetic spirit. Its true nature and composition
were first ascertained by Liebig in 1831.</p>

<p>The formation of tartar in the manufacture of
wine has been known from the earliest times.
It was regarded as, and originally styled, the
<i>faex vini</i>. The word “Tartarus” is first met
with in alchemistic literature in the eleventh
century, and is the Latinised form of an Arabic
word. Marggraf, in 1764, recognised that the
tartar of wine contained potash; but tartaric
acid itself was first isolated by Scheele in 1769.</p>

<p>The <i>double tartrate of potash and soda</i> was first
prepared in 1672 by Peter Seignette, an apothecary
of Rochelle, and was used by him in medicine.
<i>Tartar emetic</i> was discovered by Adrian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
von Mynsicht in 1631, and its true nature
explained by Bergmann in 1773. <i>Racemic acid</i>
was first mentioned by a wine manufacturer
named Kestner, and was recognised as an acid
in 1819. Its relation to tartaric acid, with
which it is isomeric, was first explained by
Berzelius, who gave it its name.</p>

<p>The naturally occurring oxalates were long
considered as identical with tartar. <i>Oxalic acid</i>
was obtained by Scheele in 1776 by means of the
action of nitric acid upon sugar. This acid was
further investigated by Bergmann, who observed
its decomposition by heat with the formation
of a gas burning with a blue flame. The
identity of the naturally occurring oxalic acid
with that prepared from sugar was established
by Scheele in 1784. The quantitative composition
of oxalic acid was first ascertained by
Dulong in 1815. <i>Mucic acid</i> was discovered
by Scheele in 1780, and was studied by Fourcroy,
who gave it the name it now bears. <i>Pyromucic
acid</i> was also known to Scheele, and was observed
by Hermbstädt and Houton-Labillardière. <i>Camphoric
acid</i> was first recognised by Bouillon-Lagrange
and Vauquelin. <i>Suberic acid</i> was
discovered by Brugnatelli in 1787.</p>

<p>That gum benzoin yielded a product (<i>benzoic
acid</i>) by sublimation was known in the sixteenth
century. It was introduced into medicine by
Turquet de Mayerne as <i>flowers of benzoin</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
Scheele showed how this acid might be obtained
by wet methods from gum-benzoin. It was
detected in Peru-balsam by Lehmann in 1709.
Rouelle found it in the urine of the cow and the
camel. Liebig, in 1829, detected the difference
between <i>hippuric acid</i> and benzoic acid. The
characteristic acid in amber (<i>succinic acid</i>) was
first detected by Pott in 1753.</p>

<p><i>Formic acid</i> was first isolated by Wray in 1676.
<i>Lactic acid</i> was discovered by Scheele in sour
milk in 1780. For a time it was regarded as
impure acetic acid, until it was detected in muscle
juice by Berzelius, and its individuality established.
Its true composition was ascertained by
Mitscherlich and by Liebig in 1832. <i>Citric acid</i>
has been known since the thirteenth century,
but it was first definitely isolated by Scheele
in 1784. Apple juice was used in medicine in
the sixteenth century, and the soda salt of its
characteristic acid (<i>malic acid</i>) was prepared by
Donald Monro in 1767.</p>

<p>It was known to the ancients that extract of
gall nuts acquired a black colour when mixed
with a solution of iron vitriol; and Boyle and
Bergmann ascribed this phenomenon to the
presence of a peculiar acid. <i>Gallic acid</i> was
first isolated by Scheele in 1785, and its composition
established by Berzelius in 1814.
<i>Tannic acid</i> was definitely recognised as distinct
from gallic acid by Seguin in 1795.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
Mellite, or honey-stone, is mentioned in mineralogical
treatises in the sixteenth century.
That it consisted of the alumina salt of a special
acid (<i>mellic acid</i>) was shown by Klaproth in 1799.</p>

<p><i>Prussian blue</i> was accidentally discovered in
1710 by a dyer named Diesbach. Its mode of
manufacture was first made known by Woodward
in 1724. The peculiar reaction by which
it was obtained was made the subject of investigation
by many chemists of the period without
any decisive result. Scheele observed that,
when the salt which occasioned the blue colour
with vitriol was distilled with sulphuric acid, a
volatile acid, inflammable and soluble in water,
was obtained. This acid received from Bergmann
the name of <i>acidum cœrulei berolinensis</i>,
or “Berlin-blue acid,” subsequently shortened
by Guyton de Morveau to <i>prussic acid</i>. Scheele
also prepared the cyanides of silver and ammonium.
That prussic acid was free from oxygen
was established by Berthollet. Anhydrous
prussic acid was first obtained by Von Ittner,
who first established its highly poisonous nature.
Bolim, in 1802, had previously observed the
presence of prussic acid in oil of bitter almonds,
the poisonous character of which was known to
Dioscorides. Porret first definitely isolated <i>potassium
ferrocyanide</i>, and subsequently discovered
the <i>thiocyanates</i>, the quantitative composition
of which was ascertained by Berzelius in 1820.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
That prussic acid was a compound of hydrogen
and cyanogen was established by Gay Lussac in
1815.</p>

<p><i>Cyanic acid</i> was discovered by Wöhler in
1822, in which year also L. Gmelin discovered
the <i>ferricyanides</i>.</p>

<p><i>Fulminating mercury</i> was first prepared by
Howard in 1800, and <i>fulminating silver</i> by Brugnatelli
in 1802. These were recognised by Liebig,
in 1822, to contain a peculiar acid, which he
termed <i>fulminic acid</i>, and which he showed to
have the same composition as the cyanic acid
discovered by Wöhler. <i>Uric acid</i>, so named by
Fourcroy, was discovered in gall stones by Scheele
in 1776. <i>Urea</i> was first definitely isolated by
Fourcroy and Vauquelin in 1799, and was synthetically
prepared by Wöhler in 1828.</p>

<p>The bitter principles of plants and their medicinal
virtues early attracted attention, but the
first attempt to isolate them was made by Fourcroy
and Vauquelin in the case of the Peruvian
bark, long known for its power as a febrifuge.
In 1806 Vauquelin obtained <i>quinic acid</i>. <i>Cinchonine</i>
was first isolated by Gomes in 1811.</p>

<p>The chemical nature of opium was the subject
of numerous inquiries in the early years of the
nineteenth century. In 1805 Sertürner detected
the existence of <i>meconic acid</i>, and in 1817 that
of <i>morphine</i>, which he recognised as an alkaloid.
<i>Narcotine</i> was discovered by Robiquet in 1835.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
The investigation of other bitter substances was
undertaken by Pelletier and Caventou, who in
1818 discovered <i>strychnine</i>, <i>brucine</i> (1819), and
<i>veratrine</i> (1820).</p>

<p>The contemporaries and immediate followers
of Lavoisier were the first to make a systematic
attempt to elucidate the chemical nature of organic
products of animal origin. To this period
belongs the work of Fourcroy and Vauquelin on
animal chemistry. Chevreul, a pupil of Fourcroy
worked on urine, adipocire, and the animal fats
in the first decade of the last century. Kirchhoff
in 1811, discovered the method of converting
starch into sugar; and Döbereiner, in 1822, described
a method of preparing formic acid artificially.
Dumas and Boullay, in 1827–1828,
prepared a number of new derivatives of ethyl
alcohol; and in 1834 Dumas and Peligot studied
in like manner the chemistry of methyl alcohol,
and pointed out many analogies which their compounds
possessed, not only among themselves,
but also to inorganic substances.</p>

<p>Although a considerable amount of information
as to the existence, modes of occurrence, and
properties of bodies found in the animal and
vegetable kingdoms had been accumulated by
the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century,
no serious attempt was made to study them
systematically until after that period. In fact,
they were not even regarded as coming within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
the operations of laws found to be applicable to
the products of the inorganic world, by the investigation,
of which products, indeed, those laws
had been discovered.</p>

<p>Down to 1828 it was considered that inorganic
and organic substances were sharply differentiated
by the circumstance that, whereas the former
might be prepared by artificial means, and even
built up from their elements by synthetic processes
in the laboratory, the latter could only be
formed in the bodies of animals and plants as the
result of vital force. In that year Wöhler showed
that urea, pre-eminently a product of animal
metabolism, could be prepared synthetically
from inorganic materials. Other instances of a
similar kind were discovered in rapid succession;
and the idea that organic substances could alone
be formed by vital processes was proved to be
invalid. Moreover, large numbers of substances
of a character analogous to those produced by
physiological action, but not known to occur in
the animal or vegetable kingdom, were prepared.
There is, therefore, no absolute distinction to be
drawn between the chemistry of the inorganic
and organic worlds.</p>

<p>At the present day we mean by “organic
compounds” simply the compounds of carbon.
These are so numerous, and frequently so complex,
that it is convenient to group them together
and study them as a special section of the science.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
At the outset it was supposed that only very
few elements entered into the composition of
organic substances. This, indeed, was held to
be a point of fundamental distinction between
organic and inorganic compounds. Lavoisier
was of opinion that all organic bodies were combinations
of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.
Berthollet first discovered the presence of nitrogen
in a product of animal origin. Sulphur and
phosphorus were detected later. There is apparently
no <i>à priori</i> reason why any element should
not be associated with carbon, and enter into
the composition of an organic compound.</p>

<p>Lavoisier was one of the first to devise methods
for ascertaining the composition of organic
(carbon) compounds, and to indicate the general
principles by which the proportion of the elements
met with in these substances can be ascertained.
So imperfectly, however, were these
methods worked out that it was not established
until the close of the first decade of the nineteenth
century that organic compounds even
obeyed the law of multiple proportions. Thanks
to the efforts of Berzelius, Gay Lussac, and
Thénard, and especially of Liebig, in 1830,
methods of organic analysis were so far perfected
that it became possible to ascertain the empirical
composition of these compounds with certainty.
This point reached, the development of this
section of chemistry proceeded with unexampled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
rapidity. Not only was the composition of
numbers of products, such as sugar, starch, the
vegetable acids, certain alkaloids, etc., established,
but altogether unlooked-for facts became
manifest. One of the most surprising of these
was that of <i>isomerism</i>.</p>

<p>Up to the close of the first quarter of the
nineteenth century it seemed self-evident that
substances of the same percentage composition
are necessarily identical. In 1823 Liebig showed
that the silver cyanate of Wöhler had the same
composition as silver fulminate. Faraday, in
1825, found a hydrocarbon in oil gas, which had
the same composition as olefiant gas, but was
otherwise different from it; and in 1828 Wöhler
discovered that urea and ammonium cyanate—perfectly
dissimilar substances—were identical
in elementary composition. Lastly, Berzelius
found this to be true of tartaric and racemic
acids; and he thereupon proposed the term
<i>isomerism</i> to denote the general fact. He further
pointed out that the phenomenon could
only be explained by supposing that the relative
positions of the atoms in isomeric compounds
are different.</p>

<p>But the influence of molecular or atomic
grouping in determining the specific character of
a substance is not confined to compounds. The
same phenomenon is observed to occur among
the elements. It was conclusively established<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
by Lavoisier that the diamond and charcoal are
chemically the same thing—both forms of
carbon. Scheele showed that graphite was a
third form of carbon. Phosphorus, sulphur,
and oxygen were subsequently shown to be each
capable of existence in various modifications.
Instances of this character were grouped together
in 1841 by Berzelius under the term <i>allotropy</i>.</p>

<p>The recognition of the fact of isomerism
exerted a great influence on the development of
organic chemistry. It ultimately led to the
assumption that particular groups of elements
or atomic complexes, so-called <i>radicals</i>, were to
be found in organic compounds—a conception
based originally on Gay Lussac’s discovery of
<i>cyanogen</i>, a combination of carbon and nitrogen,
which was found to behave like a simple substance,
such as chlorine, and to give rise to
compounds analogous to the corresponding
chlorides. This idea of the existence of compound
radicals was greatly strengthened by a
memorable investigation by Liebig and Wöhler,
in 1832, on oil of bitter almonds and its derivatives,
in which they showed that these substances
might be represented as containing a special
group or radical termed <i>benzoyl</i>, which behaved
like an element. The idea of groups of elements
going in and out of combination like a simple
substance was not new to chemists: there was
not only the case of cyanogen, discovered by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
Gay Lussac in 1815. The attempt had been
made by Dumas and Boullay in 1828 to classify
the derivatives of alcohol and ether as compounds
containing a common radical <i>etherin</i>.
Gay Lussac had pointed out that the vapour
density of ethyl alcohol seemed to show that
it consisted of equal volumes of ethylene and
water. Robiquet had also shown that ethyl
chloride might be assumed to be a compound of
hydrochloric acid and ethylene; and Döbereiner
had regarded anhydrous oxalic acid as a combination
of carbonic acid with carbonic oxide.</p>

<p>But the investigation of Liebig and Wöhler
served to give precision to the conception. It
thereby exercised a profound influence on the
development of organic chemistry by demonstrating,
in effect, that this branch of the science
might be regarded as the chemistry of the compound
radicals, in contradistinction to inorganic
chemistry—the chemistry of the simple radicals.
Additional support for this view was afforded
by the remarkable research by Bunsen on the
so-called <i>alkarsin</i>, the “fuming liquor of Cadet”—an
evil-smelling substance long known as
being formed when an acetate is heated with arsenious
oxide. Bunsen showed that this liquid
contained a compound radical having arsenic
as a constituent; and he prepared a series of
derivatives, all of which might be formulated
as combinations of this radical, which he termed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
<i>cacodyl</i>. The study of the electrolytic decomposition
of the acetates by Kolbe and the discovery
of <i>zinc-ethyl</i> by Frankland afforded
powerful support to the doctrine of combined
radicals.</p>

<p>Although there can be no doubt that this
doctrine greatly stimulated the pursuit of organic
chemistry, it was gradually perceived that to
regard inorganic and organic chemistry as the
chemistry respectively of the simple and of the
compound radicals was an imperfect and misleading
conception of the true relations of the
two main divisions of the science. Facts
showed that the properties of a substance depend
more on the arrangement of its atoms
than on their nature. The doctrine of compound
radicals was implicitly an attempt to extend the
dualistic conceptions of Berzelius to the facts of
organic chemistry; and as such it was welcomed
by the great Swedish chemist. But dualism
was found to have its limitations, even in
inorganic chemistry; and these were still more
apparent when it was sought to apply it in the
other main branch of the science. Attempts
were therefore made—notably by the French
chemists Laurent, Dumas, and Gerhardt—to
formulate organic substances by methods in
which the electro-chemical and dualistic conceptions
of Berzelius and his followers had no
part. How these attempts developed, and how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
they subsequently grew into the organic chemistry
of to-day, will be shown in the second part
of this work.</p>

<p>It will be convenient also to delay any
account of the personal history of the creators
of the science of organic chemistry—Liebig,
Wöhler, Dumas—until we are in a position to
give a fuller statement of their labours, and of
the results which flowed from them. Although
the foundations of organic chemistry may be
said to have been laid during the closing years
of the first half of the nineteenth century, the
superstructure was not erected until the second
half.</p>

<span class="subhead"><span class="smcap">The Rise of Physical Chemistry</span></span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Physics</span> and Chemistry are twin sisters—daughters
of Natural Philosophy; like Juno’s
swans, coupled and inseparable. Physics is
concerned with the forms of energy which affect
matter; chemistry with the study of matter so
affected. Each, then, is complementary to the
other. Philosophers of old drew no practical distinction
between them, at least as regards their
own studies. Men like Boyle, Black, Cavendish,
Lavoisier, Dalton, Faraday, Graham, Bunsen,
were pioneers “on a very broad gauge,” pushing
their inquiries into territories common to the two
branches as their genius or inclinations directed
them. Accordingly, it has happened that many
so-called physical laws have been discovered by
men who were professed chemists. It has also
happened that men who began their scientific
career as chemists, like Dalton, Regnault, and
Magnus, eventually gave the whole of their
energies to physical measurements; or, like
Black, Faraday, and Graham, devoted themselves
to the elucidation of physical problems.
As certain of these physical laws and problems
have greatly influenced the progress of chemistry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
it becomes necessary, in any historical
treatment of the subject, to give some account
of their origin, and to show how they affected
the development of chemical theory.</p>

<p>The relations of heat to chemical phenomena
are so obvious and so intimate that the study
of their connection necessarily attracted attention
in very early times. But it was only when
this study became quantitative that any important
generalisations became possible. Most
quantitative estimations of heat depend eventually
upon the thermometer; and thermometry
is indebted to Englishmen in the first instance
for attempts to render the instrument trustworthy.</p>

<p>In this connection may be mentioned the
names of Newton and Shuckburgh. Brooke
Taylor, in 1723, made a special study of the
mercurial thermometer as a measurer of temperature.
In other words, he sought to discover
whether equal differences of expansion or contraction
of mercury corresponded to equal
additions or abstractions of heat. The results
showed that the principle of the mercurial
thermometer is valid within at least the limits
of temperature between the boiling and freezing-points
of water. These experiments were subsequently
repeated and confirmed by Cavendish,
and, independently, by Black.</p>

<p>The discovery of the phenomenon of <i>latent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
heat</i> by Black some time prior to 1760 marks an
epoch in the history of science. It was then
for the first time clearly recognised that the
state of aggregation of a substance is associated
with a definite thermal quantity, and that, in
order to effect a change, a definite amount of
energy, in the form of heat, must be employed.
The quantitative connection that exists between
work and energy was thus foreshadowed.</p>

<p>The doctrine of <i>specific heat</i> was taught by
Black in his lectures at Glasgow between 1761
and 1765. The subject was subsequently investigated
experimentally by Irvine between
1765 and 1770, and by Crawford in 1779. A
series of determinations was published in 1781
by Wilcke, in the <i>Transactions</i> of the Swedish
Academy. In these the term <i>specific caloric</i>,
since changed to <i>specific heat</i>, was first used.
About this time the determination of the amount
of heat required to raise substances through a
definite interval of temperature was made the
subject of experiment by many observers,
notably by Lavoisier and Laplace, who greatly
improved the calorimetric arrangements. The
values they obtained long remained the most
trustworthy estimations of the specific heats of
substances. Their joint research had a further
influence on the development of thermo-chemistry
by indicating the general experimental
conditions which were needed to ensure accuracy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
in such determinations. Lavoisier and Laplace
also measured, in 1782–1783, the heat disengaged
by the combustion of substances, and
that evolved during respiration. In 1819
Dulong and Petit pointed out that the specific
heat of a number of substances, more particularly
the metals, were inversely proportional
to their atomic weights; or, in other words, the
product of the specific heat into the atomic
weight was a constant. The nature of the
relation will be seen from the following table
of certain of the results obtained by Dulong
and <span class="locked">Petit:—</span></p>

<p class="in0">It will be seen that these various elements have
an uniform, or nearly uniform, atomic heat—approximately
6.2 on the average.</p>

<p>This would appear to prove that, as Dulong
and Petit expressed it, “the atoms of simple substances
have equal capacities for heat.” The
variations from a constant value are due partly
to errors of observation, but more particularly
to the circumstance that the substances compared
are not all in a strictly comparable condition—<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span><i>e.g.</i>,
they are not all equally remote
from their melting points. It was shown, moreover,
that the amount of heat needed to raise a
substance through a definite interval of temperature
increased with the temperature. The
range of temperature through which a determination
was made in a particular instance
affected, therefore, the value of the specific
heat. The most noteworthy departures from a
uniform value were observed to occur among
the metalloids—<i>e.g.</i>, carbon, the various modifications
of which had different specific heats—and
generally among elements of low atomic
weight, in which the variation of specific heat
with temperature was particularly rapid.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the significance of the generalisation
discovered by Dulong and Petit, in spite
of its limitations, was quickly appreciated, as it
was perceived that a knowledge of the specific
heat of an element might be of great value in
determining its atomic weight. The immediate
effect was that a certain number of the atomic
weights fixed by Berzelius mainly on chemical
considerations were required to be halved.
Although subsequent experience has proved that
the law of Dulong and Petit is not capable of the
simple mathematical expression they gave it, it
has shown itself to be of great value in fixing
doubtful atomic weights.</p>

<p><b>Pierre Louis Dulong</b> was born in 1785 at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
Rouen, and, after studying chemistry and physics
at the Polytechnic School at Paris, became
its Professor of Chemistry and subsequently its
Professor of Physics. In 1830 he was made its
Director of Studies; and in 1832 he became permanent
Secretary of the Academy of Sciences.
As a young man he worked with Berzelius, with
whom he made the first approximately accurate
determination of the gravimetric composition
of water. In 1811 he discovered the highly
explosive <i>nitrogen chloride</i>, in the investigation of
which he was severely injured, losing an eye and
several fingers. He died in 1838. His collaborator,
<b>Alexis Therese Petit</b>, was born in 1791 at
Vesoul, and died, when holding the position
of Professor of Physics at the Lycée Bonaparte,
in 1820.</p>

<p>The attempt made by Neumann to extend
Dulong and Petit’s “law” to compound substances
was only partially successful. Nor has
any important generalisation followed from our
knowledge of the specific heat of liquids. Almost
simultaneously with the publication of
Dulong and Petit’s “law,” Mitscherlich made
known the fact that similarity in chemical constitution
is frequently accompanied by identity
of crystalline form. Boyle, as far back as the
middle of the seventeenth century, had insisted
upon the importance of the forms of crystals in
throwing light upon the internal structure of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
bodies. Romé de l’Isle and Hauy had remarked
that many different substances had the same
crystalline form. It had been observed that a
crystal of potash alum would continue to grow
and preserve its shape in a solution of ammonia
alum; and similar observations had been shown
to occur in the case of vitriols. The invention
of the reflecting goniometer by Wollaston greatly
facilitated the investigation of such phenomena.
Mitscherlich showed that the phosphates and
arseniates of analogous composition had the
same crystalline shape, or, in other words, were
isomorphous. The same fact was observed to
occur in the case of the analogously constituted
sulphates and selenates, and in that of the oxides
of magnesium and zinc, etc. The value of isomorphous
relations in determining the group-relationships
of the elements and in deducing the
composition of salts was at once recognised by
Berzelius, who styled the discovery of isomorphism
by his pupil Mitscherlich as “the most
important since the establishment of the doctrine
of chemical proportions.” The quantities of
the isomorphously replacing elements in a compound
were regarded by him as a measure of
their atomic weights; and the principle was subsequently
constantly employed by him, whenever
possible, as a criterion in fixing their values.
Other investigators have followed his example
in this respect; and isomorphism is still regarded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
as an important consideration in establishing the
genetic relations of an element.</p>

<p><b>Eilhard Mitscherlich</b>, the son of a minister,
was born in 1794 at Neu Ende, near Jever, in
Oldenburg, and, after studying philology and
oriental languages at Heidelberg, went to Paris,
and thence to Göttingen, where he occupied
himself with natural science. In 1818 he repaired
to Berlin and commenced to work on
the arseniates and phosphates, the similarity in
the crystal-forms of which he was the first to
detect. His friend Gustav Rose, the mineralogist,
thereupon instructed him in the methods
of crystallography; to enable him to verify his
discovery and to establish it by goniometric
measurements. In 1821 he joined Berzelius at
Stockholm, where he pursued his inquiries on
the connection between crystal-form and chemical
composition. It was at the suggestion of
Berzelius that he adopted the term “isomorphy”
to express this connection—the mechanical
consequence of identity of atomic constitution.
In the same year he was appointed Klaproth’s
successor in Berlin, where he died in 1863.</p>

<p>Mitscherlich also worked on the manganates
and permanganates, on selenic acid, on benzene
and its derivatives, and on the artificial production
of minerals.</p>

<p>The study of the physical phenomena of gases,
initiated in 1660 by Boyle’s discovery of the law<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
of gaseous pressure, has greatly contributed to
our knowledge of their intrinsic nature. Boyle
himself only proved his law in the case of
atmospheric air; but the observation was subsequently
(1676) generalised by Marriotte.
Charles, Dalton, and Gay Lussac independently
showed that gases have the same rate of
thermal expansion.</p>

<p>That gases are made up of particles possessing
an internal movement was surmised by the
Greeks; but experimental evidence for such a
view of their constitution was first presented
by Thomas Graham in 1829–1831, when he
discovered that gases move, or are diffused,
at rates inversely proportional to the square
roots of their densities. Observations of a like
character, which found their explanation in
Graham’s discovery, had previously been made
by Priestley, Döbereiner, and Saussure. This
interchange in the position of their particles is
a property inherent in gases. Inequality of
density is not essential to diffusion. Graham
proved this by connecting together two vessels,
one containing nitrogen and the other carbonic
oxide, which have the same density. After the
expiration of a certain time both gases were
found to be uniformly diffused through the
vessels.</p>

<p>How these laws were found to be interdependent
and mutually connected, and how they led<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
up to a molecular theory of gases which serves
to explain them, as well as certain other gaseous
phenomena to be subsequently noted, will be
shown in the second part of this work.</p>

<p>By the end of the period with which we are concerned—that
is, the middle of the nineteenth
century—a considerable body of information
had been accumulated as to the conditions
which determine the different states of aggregation
of matter—that is, the conditions which
allow of the passage of the gaseous state into
that of the liquid, and of the liquid into that
of the solid. That the same substance was
capable of existence in the three states of gas,
liquid, and solid was of course evident from the
case of water. Even the most primitive races
must have realised that steam, dew, rain, snow,
hail, and ice were only modifications of one and
the same substance. As knowledge increased,
other substances came to be known which
resembled water in their capacity for existence
in various physical states. It was but natural
to assume that this was a general attribute, and
that all substances would, sooner or later, be
found capable of existence in each of the different
conditions of aggregation.</p>

<p>Attempts were made during the first quarter
of the last century to prove that all the æriform
bodies then known were simply vapours more or
less remote from their point of liquefaction, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
still further removed from their point of congelation.
Monge and Clouet condensed sulphur
dioxide some time before 1800; and Northmore,
in 1805, liquefied chlorine. But these observations
attracted little attention until Faraday,
in 1823, independently effected the liquefaction
of chlorine, and Davy that of hydrochloric acid.
Faraday almost immediately afterwards liquefied
sulphur dioxide, sulphuretted hydrogen, carbon
dioxide, euchlorine, nitrous oxide, cyanogen,
and ammonia.</p>

<p>Other experimenters, among whom may be
mentioned Thilorier and Natterer, greatly improved
the mechanical appliances for liquefying
these gases; liquid carbonic acid and nitrous
oxide were obtained in considerable quantities,
and employed in the production of cold. Certain
of the gases—hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,
nitric oxide, carbonic oxide, etc.—resisted all
attempts to liquefy them; and hence gaseous
substances came to be classified as <i>permanent</i> and
<i>non-permanent</i>, depending upon whether they
could or could not be liquefied. The division
was felt to be irrational even at the time it was
made. There seemed no <i>à priori</i> reason why
carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide should be
liquefiable, while carbonic oxide and nitric
oxide should resist all attempts to coerce them
into changing their state. The real clue to the
conditions required to effect the liquefaction of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
a gas was not discovered until nearly half a
century later, when, as will be shown subsequently,
the arbitrary division of gases into
permanent and non-permanent was swept away.</p>

<p>The discovery of the law of gaseous combination
by Gay Lussac, and the recognition by
Ampère and Avogadro of the relation between
the density of a gas or a vapour and its atomic
weight, early led to improvements in the methods
of determining the absolute weights of gases and
vapours, especially by French chemists. Both
Gay Lussac and Dumas devised processes for
determining vapour densities which were in use
until late in the century, and which, although
now superseded by more convenient and more
rapid modifications afforded valuable information
concerning the molecular weights of
substances and the phenomena of gaseous
dissociation.</p>

<p>During the first decade of the nineteenth
century Dalton and Henry discovered the simple
law which connects pressure with the solubility
of a gas in any solvent upon which it exerts no
specific action. Dalton further developed the
law so as to include the absorption by a solvent
of the several constituents of a gaseous mixture.</p>

<p>Attempts were made by Schröder, Kopp, and
others, to discover relations between the weights
of unit volumes of liquids and solids and their
chemical nature; but such attempts were only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
partially successful, owing to the difficulty of
finding valid conditions of comparison. By
comparing the specific gravities of liquids at
their boiling-points Kopp succeeded in detecting
a number of regularities among their specific
volumes which seem to indicate that a comprehensive
generalisation connecting them may yet
be discovered. Kopp has also shown that
regularities exist among the boiling-points of
correlated substances, and that there is an
interdependence between the temperature of
their ebullition and the chemical characters of
compounds.</p>

<p>This short summary will suffice to show that
attempts to discover relations between the
physical attributes of substances and their
chemical nature were made more or less sporadically
from the time that chemistry was pursued
in the spirit of science. But it is only in recent
times that any great accession to knowledge
has resulted from such efforts. The science of
physical chemistry is practically a creation of
our own period. Its systematic study may be
said to date only from the last quarter of the
nineteenth century, since which time it has
made extraordinary progress. Its broad features
will be dealt with in the second volume of
this work.</p>

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
